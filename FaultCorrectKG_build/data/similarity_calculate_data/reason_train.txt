hdfs dfs pwd does not exist because there is no working directory concept in hdfs when you run commands from command line
you cannot execute hdfs dfs cd in hdfs shell and then run commands from there since both hdfs shell and hdfs dfs cd commands do not exist too thus making the idea of working directory redundant
there is no cd command so i guess you expect pwd to return the home directory
however when the write buffer is larger and not a multiple of the response buffer this seems to cause some weirdness in how the flushes are handled causing extra flushes leading to bad performance
it turns out that resp setbuffersize will only increase the buffer size and since the default size is 24kb resp setbuffersize 4096 is a no op
however when the call to flush is removed it will let the buffer fill up again with 12 bytes spilling into the next chunk because 24 is a multiple of 4
you can manually specify every field of the table to get the same result
this is because you dont have enough permission to create directory in hdfs
try running this as sudo but this is not recommended because it compromises security
i checked out the pom xml under hadoop common for that execution id and ran the following command it gave me the following exception since i do not have visual studio 2010 on my machine the problem had to be in the solution
download hadoop 2 2 0 src tar gz and extract to a folder having short path say c hdfs to avoid runtime problem due to maximum path length limitation in windows
in my case this was the reason for the issue
is plugin flexible enough to give access to generated schema files so further actions such as registration schema in schema repository can be made
looking at the job information its making a copy of the conf object you are supplying to it the job makes a copy of the configuration so that any necessary internal modifications do not reflect on the incoming parameter
there might be additional things needed but at first pass through the problem this seems like the most likely cause
this issue occurs when for security reasons tmp is mounted non exec
reply to comment 1 actually the whole resultant tuple would be null so there is no fields inside
it seems the problem is that two spark nodes are independently trying to write to the same place causing conflicts as the fastest one will clear up the working directory before the second one expects it
check out the load balancing strategy property of the queue that depends on attributes
i should add that trying to commit data to s3a is not reliable precisely because of the way it mimics rename by what is something like ls rlf src xargs p8 i cp dst rm
because ls has delayed consistency on s3 it can miss newly created files so not copy them
this is really easy since you just split each line on and you have an array you can loop through
your hadoop cluster has only 3 nodes and vertica is co located on them so you should be getting the benefits of node locality automatically vertica will use the nodes that have the data locally when planning queries
my case was that i put a space between d and java which caused the failure should be as below but in my case i had this
took me two weeks of digging to find hbase could really use some better documentation as far as what needs to go into those methods i m still having trouble in that regard
i tried changing the owner the hbase config for the hbase lib folder creating a new folder but couldn t replicate it so it could just come down to the hbase restart
i do not know if this is the correct way to nuke the hbase data but when i run into such inconsistencies i usually delete all the contents the directory which is holding hbase data so the place would be look for the following property in hbase site xml hbase rootdir i have not used this approach once the system got stable on my local dev machine
you cannot access these methods because as for now spark 1 6 these are not implemented in pyspark
based on the avro specification json encoding except for unions the json encoding is the same as is used to encode field default values
here still has some issues this solution doesn t support record enum or fixed avro type because these types require user defined name
personally i think records should not be null because i consider records are what i need to make sure exists if something is missing that means i have bigger problem
also i am not sure about the true constant but you can write 0 0 to the same effect
you could trade some communication for memory by re organizing the computation so that every reducer computes a square submatrix of the final matrix knowing only two subsets of the points and calculating the distances among all of them
this problem does not sound like a good fit for map reduce since you re not really able to break it into pieces and calculate each piece independently
that is because of the encryption the file length in a list was the length in a read
it turns out hive doesn t trim the dynamodb column mappings after splitting on the commas so the list of column mappings must not contain spaces
thanks to antonio for the help in the rhadoop forums
the most common solution of these kind of problem is re installation since in sesssioninfo you are getting while when i did sessioninfo i got i guess there is some missing dependencies you might be missing so use from your r console to fix any problem due to any other packages
if still that does not help i recommend you use r base dev as your r version though i don t have a reason to justify this using http cran r project org bin linux ubuntu readme thanks
https www cloudera com documentation enterprise 5 8 x topics impala create table html note the create table clauses fields terminated by escaped by and lines terminated by have special rules for the string literal used for their argument because they all require a single character
see https github com mongodb mongo hadoop commit 766922b656d11fd5e661eecb0cc370ba3f86b0d4 in this case adding leads to the desired outcome
if your unprivileged user does not have a directory in user it may result in the write permissions denied error
the step for yarn must happen after kerberos installation because what it is doing is removing the user cache for non kerberized yarn data
for example hdfs whatever realm maps to the service user hdfs in your operating system only because of a name mapping rule set in the core site of hadoop
good has a name mapping rule by default hdfs realm hdfs host realm bad no name mapping rule by default hdfs tag realm the bad example will not work unless you add a rule to accommodate it name rules mapping http www cloudera com documentation archive cdh 4 x 4 5 0 cdh4 security guide cdh4sg topic 19 html the key version number kvno is the version of the key that is actively being used as if you had a house key but then changed the lock on the door so it used a new key the old one is no longer any good
by default when you use ktadd or xst to export the principal to a keytab it changes the keytab version number but does not change the kvno of the principal so you can end up accidentally creating a mismatch
this is an install issue but it is easy to miss because you can think you have the security jars installed when you really don t
when i did a kinit it created the ticket in tmp because the cache name was being set elsewhere as tmp
i don t think we can overwrite some method inside the process as createsubmittablejob because of the visibility of the attributes
the method is as follows this causes the taskattempt to fail
finally you should probably set mapred map max attempts to 1 so that a failed taskattempt is a failed task
based on your description it sounds like this should be an evalfunc databag not evalfunc tuple
change the permission so that it has execute permission for the user
from one of the mapreduce tutorials therefore you should replace string class with text class and integer class with intwritable class
short answer because it is more efficient
the writable interface omits the type definition when serializing because you already define the types of the input output in your mapreduce code
if you have a file called export hql and in that file your code is then your bash command can be the f command executes the hive file and the append pipes the results to the text file
in that case the best bet is to run as a java job from hue then you can explicitly manage weather it is mapreduce or mapred
if name node goes down framework doesn t no where the data should store and doesn t no where space available to be store so it s not possible to sore actual data
job tracker is responsible for job schedule and process the data
if you want a higher block size set the desired block size value on the corresponding job only on the pig script set dfs block size 134217728 alternatively you can also increase minimum split size because the split size is calculated based on the formula restricting the number of blocks created is not possible it has to be controlled by minsplitsize maxsplitsize and blocksize parameters only
it is because of the same class representation in different jar i e hadoop commons and hadoop core having the same class
this is probably caused by https issues apache org jira browse mapreduce 5465 which is fixed in newer hadoop versions
system will search for relevant section in jaas config based on sun security krb5 principal setting and will use this principal and its corresponding keytab for kerberos authentication
if you re querying large volumes of data this approach should perform better than jdbc because it will be able to unload and query the data in parallel
anyway you can use redshift for machine learning depends on tool your using or algorithm you implementing
i am uploading orc screen shot which was produce from this hive queries and generated orc result file for above hive queries
the reason you are seeing the error message is because of command typo that is why namenode class is showing the usage error may be you have issued the command option improperly
then of course ambari start button cannot be used because the configuration would be smashed thus it is necessary to re start all the services manually
this is not the definitive solution since it is desirable this changes of configuration could be done from ambari ui
you can update intermediate results to memcached if eah record has less size 1mb
however in your case due to java memory mapped files implementation non heap memory requirements are higher than heap memory and thats why you had to keep quite large gap between total and heap memory
table scan in a nifty distributed map reduce way but nevertheless it s a table scan each time to extract all the data you ve requested so all your queries will require a lot of time to finish
this way can cause problems if you plan to have a lot of low latency queries
i followed this tutorial and wrote the following command to upload all texttiles 4 at a time print0 to do a null separated token list 0 so xarg can recognize the null separator n so that several puts are run in parallel i so that each token is included into the hadoop fs put token goes here i don t think this approach respects folder structures meaning the folder structure from your local system is not preserved on the cluster
the vm they had available for the course was super slow so i setup my own windows 7 vm in parallels
i tried setting java options to increase the memory available to the jvm as some posts had suggested but that had no effect
are the input documents the result of exporting content using mlcp
you don t have start object so it is not differentiate between rows
take 2 ok so you can t properly stream data into hive
and that s also why you have no insert values command hence the lame syntax displayed in your post as a necessary workaround
this is because of the lack of permission to the user aseema in hdfs
regarding the connections you mention to 50075 they are correct as well since that s the behaviour of webhdfs when you want to upload data to hdfs first the client in this case cygnus accesses the namenode through tcp 50070 port then the namenode responds with a redirection location pointing to the datanode where the data will be effectively uploaded such a redirection uses the tcp 50075 port and thus that datanode 50075 must be accessible by the client cygnus
in order to flush out the results to hdfs you have to call the close method of the textoutputformat after you ve finished writing the records
there are actually two reasons the output format wasn t flushed as till rohrmann pointed out
since i use the format in a streaming job closing the format was no option
if you are trying to setup in hbase in pseudo distributed mode most probable reason for this adding hadoop home to path
this is only a custom because it is expected behaviour
hadoop or any other library is therefore allowed to break the rules on this
how you should do it like the other answers mentioned in the link retain a list of already iterated items for a later repeat iteration but be warned this may be a huge collection in a live hadoop environment so you may well break
if any of above three processes fails job recovery will be done depending on respective process recovery
resource manager recovery with the resourcemanger restart enabled the rm being promoted current standby to an active state loads the rm internal state and continues to operate from where the previous active left off as much as possible depending on the rm restart feature
i m not completely sure of the following since i haven t tested it out
what a lucky punch fighting with that one for days and know i got it working since the local unix execution of worked fine i had the idea to use 1 merged input file instead of the provided 6 input files so then executing the very same hadoop command again directing the input to the mergedinputfile in the input folder perfect result no problem no exception job done
based on this understanding i removed from directory name and re ran the sqoop import command and all worked fine
your example shows you setting the average size to 100 bytes which would create a lot of small files and is most likely being ignored because the files are already larger than that
1 single insert can result in one or more files under the hdfs location
from my previous experience there are two possible scenarios which might be causing this not very descriptive error i am submitting jobs from eclipse but using java i noticed that you are not passing the jar to the configuration of the sparkcontext
add solr to your zookeeper url so it looks like host port solr
if your application is not dependent on group memberships for anything such as hdfs file permissions granting access to a group then that might be acceptable for your use case
options 1 2 context getconfiguration get map input file context getconfiguration get mapreduce map input file i believe both of these return null because they should be used with the older mapred api and its jobconf configuration object
you can see this in the error you re getting caused by java lang classcastexception org apache hadoop mapreduce lib input filesplit cannot be cast to org apache hadoop mapred filesplit you ve imported import org apache hadoop mapred filesplit which is from the mapred api but you re using the mapreduce api
because of that we ll use mapvalues to serialize only keys now we can follow it with simple format and save to read the file we reverse the process
i would recommend using a spark job to transfer the data or if you must use sqoop depending on what you are doing datastax enterprise includes a custom sqoop driver for cassandra
such error happen when spark shell try to find spark libraries but because spark home is not set it can t find libraries
depending on the size of your data you might have to look at doing the query per partition
because you specified no ranges accumuloinputformat will automatically fetch all of the tablet boundaries for your table and create the same number of rangeinputsplit objects as you have tablets in the table
some how this is failing because there is not enough serialized data to deserialize what the version of accumulo running in the mapper expects to read
side note windows support for titan 0 5 x may be more substantial so you could look into that as well
at the moment you ve specified mapfileoutputformat as the output to the first job with no input specified in the second so it will be textinputformat which is unlikely to work
you have it should be because of this it won t be calling your implementation so it will just be an identity reduce
this is because the console producer has acks 0 by default
ensure your rdds are ok by performing count on rdd1 to materialize results performing count on rdd2 if counts are ok try with caching results before saving into es it the problem still appears try to look at dead executors stderr and stdout you can find them on executors tab in sparkui
based on the problem description it sounds entirely possible the ad admin is looking at the wrong account
in my case the hbase don t have enough permisson to operate tmp directory on hdfs so i change it and the problem was gone
you could also fix the error by modifying fs defaultfs in your core site xml however this could impact other systems that share the core site xml file so i recommend the first approach of passing an alluxio uri to filesystem get
i also could not find the exact reason but bouncing mysql server and resetting all helped me
using date t is not possible as the command result would contain characters in it like 11 12 45 and creating filenames with character is not possible in hdfs
and then you move the report results from hdfs to cassandra in a dedicated reports table partitioned by user id
so when the user wants to have some aggregation report about his activity in the last month the application takes the id of active user and returns the aggregated result from cassandra as it is simple key value search
so for your question yes it could be an alternative but the selection strategy depends on the data types and your application business cases
the docker provisioner is tested to work on mac and amazon linux for bigtop releases just because of the resource limitation
just in case you missed to refer the documentation https www cloudera com documentation enterprise 5 12 x topics impala jdbc html pay attention to this extract since you are using a remote machine to access impala refer to this information also if not done earlier update the jdbc connector and make sure that all the impalad instances are running
then compare the performance results of odbc and jdbc
1 1024 https www cloudera com documentation enterprise 5 12 x topics impala batch size html 1 65536 https www cloudera com documentation enterprise 5 14 x topics impala batch size html so when i increase it throgh a odbc ini with ssp batch size i can benifit from increasing the other odbc parameters rowsfetchedperblock tsasltransportbufsize and the rows can be fetched in a seconds 45 secs instead of tens of minutes
it s possible that your is an alias and it s not defined on yarn nodes or is not resolved on the yarn nodes for other reasons
you might get no route to host if webhdfs is disabled or the datanode is not exposing port 50075 the datanode http address because it s down or you changed that property you re running hdfs in pseudo distributed mode but you re trying to read a local file
this is because org apache hadoop io writable is mean to be loaded by typeextractor class getclassloader which is appclassloader and the submited flink jar is loaded by parentfirstclassloader which is the child of appclassloader so appclassloader can not load org apache hadoop io writable from your flink jar
as hadoop was the user that lauched hdfs and yarn he is the user that will try to open a file in a job so it must be authorized to access this folder fortunely hadoop checks what user is executing the job first to allow the access to a folder file so you will not take risks at this
first of all if you check the log you ll see following warning it is there for the reason
take away message here is to read warnings and not to depend on schema inference which is quite often unreliable and expensive
as i see it you want for each city to have the product with max sales in that particular city don t you
the mapper will regroup your data so that city will be a key and product count will be a value and then reduce will maintain maximum value for each city
summing a bunch of 1s has the same effect as counting them
distribute by partition key helps with oom issue but this configuration may cause each reducer writing the whole partition depending on hive exec reducers bytes per reducer configuration which can be set very high value by default like 1gb
distribute by partition key may cause additional reduce stage the same does hive optimize sort dynamic partition
so to avoid oom and achieve maximum performance add distribute by partition key at the end of your insert query this will cause the same partition keys to be processed by the same reducer s
just check what is current value of hive exec reducers bytes per reducer and reduce or increase it accordingly to get proper reducer parallelism
distribute by make more reduce tasks so it can make more files in each partition but there is same memory problem
consequently containers memory size is really important
it seems that you have already stored the data on each of the nodes so you have already solved the distributed storage element of the problem
since each node s dataset is different this isn t a parallel processing problem either
you run the clustering algorithm on each node and then handle the results in whatever way you need
another way sort of scala collections zip map style note that i have broken down and included var df2 df3 df4 df so that it will be easy to follow the steps
do not have query plan yet so maybe there is something else but these settings definitely are limiting reducers parallelism i d suggest to increase the number of reducers allowed and reduce bytes per reducer this will increase parallelism on reducers also hive 1 2 0 provides auto rewrite optimization for count distinct
so before changing anything in mysql the hive service throws the following error caused by java sql sqlexception access denied for user root localhost we need to set root localhost to use mysql native password authentication and set a password as mentioned by rajesh still hive throws errors for me since the mysql schema loaded wasn t updated
now that you have some insight how much effort goes into the release of just one distribution with comparatively strong focus on recent versions you might understand that there will not be a general overview of how everything works with everything beyond these distributions
reducers can start copying results from mappers as soon as they become available
to understand preemption read this and this following is the sample configuration that we are using in our aws cloudformation script to launch an emr cluster capacity scheduler configuration yarn site configuration with the above you have to specify your jobs on the particular queue based on your use case
this is error returned when you trying to split region of meta table region which in closed closing state region has references to other region region which is result of recent split of other region i think you faced last case
this is due to files which contains data of parent region store files not touched during split hbase delays real split of data files until compaction
understanding executions plans to get a true grasp on what causes a query to take a long time you need to understand what operations hive or impala will perform when it executes a query
statistics also help your system prevent issues due to memory usage and resource limitations
build the project ant cd into the piggybank dir cd contrib piggybank java build the piggybank ant you should now see a piggybank jar file in that directory
here s what you can do hadoop by default uses a hashing partitioner like this key hashcode numreducers so you can pick keys such that they hash to 1 2 and 3 or three numbers such that x 3 1 2 3
when using streaming there can t be any loss of functionality since the functionality is basicly map reduce the data you are getting from hadoop stream
importantly clouderas vm distro defaults to localhost for some reason
two options put the configuration files in the classpath so that the code picks it
i met this problem with exactly same error logs but difference reason
i ve had a similar problem on a cluster where executing tasks failed on some nodes due to out of memory problems
the computation eventually failed because it was badly designed causing all nodes to run out of memory and eventually the threshold for cancelling the job was reached
we had the same exception and the reason was that we had the wrong dependencies in the pom files
we were pointing to hadoop client version 2 0 0 cdh4 0 0 which is for yarn but we are using mrv1 so we should have been pointing to 2 0 0 mr1 cdh4 0 0
therefore the reducers have smaller sorted data in their incoming
that is pretty much the reason why the default configuration for any hadoop mapreduce cluster not just emr is to have more mappers than reducers proportional to the number of cores available to the jobtracker
if i understand correctly you re dealing with daily logs therefore i suggest you set a parent output directory say called output and set your output directory in the script to be output daily date
we did so because the whole distro is not tiny and we wanted to take advantage of the caching features of streaming plus components of r are not relocatable
we did so because the whole distro is not tiny and we wanted to take advantage of the caching features of streaming plus components of r are not relocatable so you would rebuild the jar and move it to hdfs whenever you update something or add a package
we have a proof of concept in the branch 0 install but it works only for ubuntu ec2 and apparently i managed to hard code some paths that i shouldn t have and i am making a number of other assumptions so this is only for developers willing to chip in but the main ingredients are all in place
either way the file or unpacked files will be available in the current working directory when your code executes and from there you ll be able to register the modules packages as per the mechanisms available in r i ve never used r so you re on your own from here
thanks to alexeipab for the link to another so question
your code would look something like this keep in mind that the fact we are sorting based on the samp field is defined in the define statement by passing 3 as the first param
the cloudera distribution of hadoop has separate maven artifacts that you can depend on to build with the old versions
one side effect is that code compiled against hadoop 1 0 cdh3 is not compatible with hadoop 2 0 cdh4 and vice versa
however source code is compatible and thus one just need to recompile code with target hadoop distribution
there is no explicit information for which hadoop version couchbase connector was compiled so i would guess that it was against hadoop 1 0 and thus it s not working on hadoop 2 0 cdh4
the way you re doing it right now since you re writing to the regular context it will get picked up by the default output format of textoutputformat and not the one you defined in your multipleoutputs
have a look at the logs in the following path based on the information supplied above this should provide you with some information on that specific task
i couldn t change the permissions because of the certain policies set
i spent some time searching for a response to the same issue also using vm with cdh4 so i shall leave my solution here in hopes that it might help others
please note that hbase needs zk s services even in standalone mode so you should make sure that it s running ok hth
in your case hbase is not able to start the zk because another instance is probably already running on port 2181
hence comparing each other like one to one would be real performance bottle neck
in each reduce 1 since the values are sorted as above when we begin iteration we would get the 0 in the first iteration and with it the index id 2 which could then be used for subsequent iterations
in the next two iteration we get review ids 1 and 2 consecutively and we use a counter so that we could keep track of any repeated review ids
pseudo code for reducer this job is done with multiple reducers in order to leverage hadoop for what it best known for performance as a result the final output will be scattered something like the following deviating from your desired output
you can load the term index list in hadoop distributed cache so that it is available to mappers and reducers
what you are going to want to do is have 2 3 jobs that feed each other to get the desired result
apparently the jar for org apache avro has a different set of methods than the jar distributed from the apache website causing the mismatch
see this other so question for more details
the output is as expected because you used the following which should have been you extended the mapper and reducer classes with map and reduce but didn t use them in your job
executed select from table and now results was returned correctly
executed a select from table name and no results was getting returned
executed command invalidate metadata in the impala shell executed command refresh table name executed command show tables executed command select from table name and now results are getting displayed both in the impala shell and hive shell
it looks like a known issue in jira copying data between 0 20 and 2 2 0 hadoop version https issues apache org jira browse hdfs 3054
i was using that initially so it was not working
one more question i have based on this is that how can i make it to work for domain rather than using for localhost and port
it must be comparable too so that hadoop can sort the key value pairs
newfile txt is a relative path so the file would show up relative to your map task process s working directory
this is configuration property yarn nodemanager local dirs in yarn site xml or the default inherited from yarn default xml which is under tmp here is a concrete example of one such directory in my test environment these directories are scratch space for container execution so they aren t something that you can rely on for persistence
it is possible to delay the cleanup by setting the configuration property yarn nodemanager delete debug delay sec in yarn site xml however please keep in mind that this configuration is intended only for troubleshooting issues so that you can see the directories more easily
if application logic depends on the delete delay then that s likely to cause a race condition between the application logic attempting to access the directory and the nodemanager attempting to delete it
since hadoop is distributed you may have a hard time finding which node in a cluster of hundreds or thousands contains the local file that you want
i experienced the issue when copying many small files in the order of thousands which in total did not account for more than half a gigabyte
you are getting an error because exchange is a keyword used to move the data in a partition from a table to another table that has the same schema but does not already have that partition for details view hive language manual and hive 4095
thus p1 will contain url for f1 f10 p2 will urls for f11 f20 and so on
thus the mapper m1 processing file p1 will open file f1 thru f10 one at a time and process it wholly
i could make this even dirtier by generating the file part number from the partitioner but i am looking for a clean solution so please post if there is a better approach to this problem
one version inverted timestamp setting versions to 1 for htable and putting based on long max value system currenttimemillis will generally work and does not have any major performance issues
it should be noted that this might not actually be the machine who tried to write to the cell first since hbase clients might be out of sync
this can happen at any time since your writes can occur at any time even after compaction
as you can imagine this has a pretty big performance impact for each write since each write now also involves a read and a lock
during compaction nothing needs to happen because only one put will ever make it to hbase
it should be noted that there is no way to batch these kind of checkandput operations by using checkandmutate since each put needs it own check
on read only ever one version will make it to hbase so there is no impact here
picking between strategies if true ordering really matters or you may need to read each row after or before you write to hbase anyway for example to find out if your write succeeded or not you re better of with strategy 2 otherwise in all other cases i d recommend strategy 1 since its write performance is much better
in that case just make sure your clients are properly time synced
this way only the first earliest put will be returned by the scan because all successive puts will have a smaller timestamp value
your current code does not return anything and thus is of type unit
therefore it is necessary for your yarn nodes to have python installed for this to work
then how many times an exception can be thrown before the entire job gets stopped is as below for map tasks mapreduce map maxattempts property for reducer tasks mapreduce reduce maxattempts default is 4 handling malformed data so we decided to handle the malformed data
context getcounter temperature over 10 increment 1 with the above method all records get processed and the counters get added based on the bad records
this happens due to version conflict
again the log retention is determined by the configuration parameter yarn log aggregation retain seconds how long to retain the aggregated logs
since you are passing an hdfs path the exception is being thrown
i consider it a better practice because you don t need to read entire query to notice that the left join is in fact an anti join
this could just be some error in the protoc files which isn t being reported as such instead mvn is just failing without showing the root cause
thanks to ramprasad g s reply we can look into the case study http www deerwalk com blog bulk importing data this case study will tell us more about hbase bulk import and the reducer class keyvaluesortreducer
the reason of sorting all keyvalue in keyvaluesortreducer reduce method is that the hfile need this sorting
the reason of phoenix csv bulkload reducer casue oom is the issue refer to phoenix 2649
due to the comparator inside csvtablerowkeypair error to compare two csvtablerowkeypair and make all rows to pass by one single reducer in one single reduce call it will cause oom quickly in my case
i m using maven so i prevented the jni jar from being included in my uberjar using maven shade plugin
i still don t know if this is the best way since the flink manual discourages using the lib folder because it doesn t respect their classloader management https ci apache org projects flink flink docs release 1 0 apis cluster execution html but that s exactly what i wanted
you provide wordwithcount as argument so the type of datastream should be wordwithcount
that question for example old school yeah read the csv directly using the spark csv plugin with option header clearly that s the way to go but mind the dependency on apache commons csv jar that should be made explicit in the documentation note that when hitting the csv file s directly you lose the benefit of having the hive metastore hide the actual hdfs directory or directories in case the table is partitioned so you are back to hard coding paths in your code
there is also this option it also uses jrecord https wiki cask co display ce plugin for cobol copybook reader fixed length it is based on copybookhadoop which looks to be a clone of copybookinputformat that thiago has mentioned
variables shell actions have an explicit env var var value env var syntax because shell scripts rely a lot on env
java pig sqoop spark hive hive2 shell can benefit from a property name oozie launcher xxx xxx xxx env name value value property to override the values in client config files that are mentioned above mapreduce actions are launched directly there is no launcher job so the property would be set directly as property name xxx xxx xxx env name value value property in addition the actions defined in the core workflow schema i e
properties you will have to make some research in stack overflow in that post for example
nodemanager responsible for containers launch monitoring their resource usage cpu memory disk network and reporting it to the resourcemanager scheduler
for the sake of future visitors spark introduced the spark task reaper since 2 0 3 which does address this scenario more or less and is a built in solution
my need was to kill jobs hanging for too much time my jobs extract data from oracle tables but for some unknonw reason seldom the connection hangs forever
according to setjobgroup if interruptoncancel is set to true for the job group then job cancellation will result in thread interrupt being called on the job s executor threads
from the documentation looks like the main reason is when we run the spark submit from remote to reduce the latency between executors and driver cluster mode is preferred
i just happened to try this out with writing a parquet output based on avro schema and generated specificrecord to s3
the select statement runs a mapper mapreduce depends on the select query job to write data into the target table sample table from the source table sample table unique
based on the number of tasks the number of files generated may vary
the values for hive merge smallfiles avgsize and hive merge size per task are default ones change them accordingly to the input size
depends on which version of hive you re using you can always find out the corresponding spark version in pom xml file of hive
i don t know why but the command in hive on spark getting started does not work for me finally i succeeded with following command and few other troubleshooting tips which i met before hope you re not going to meet starting spark master failed due to failed to find slf4f or hadoop related classes run export spark dist classpath hadoop classpath and try again failed to load snappy native libs which is caused by that there s no snappy dependency in classpath or the snappy lib under hadoop classpath is not the correct version for spark
without knowing in more detail what your software is or where it is run you can use a nfs server so you can mount the hdfs volume and access to it locally
so if you can afford to stop start the yarn then here is the process note before killing the yarn read here on the effects on the system depending on your yarn version
when 192 168 2 5 connect 192 168 2 230 docker forwards the 7077 port to 1 6 version spark so it s incompatible error
had same problem solved by finding the appropriate container s ip address 172 18 0 1 instead of 127 0 0 1 because i was accessing it from another container
that ip address could be found using ifconfig command just adding that it in some cases the cause of this issue might be that the ip not even having service at all or is inaccessible
if you are passing classof no implicit conversion is needed since these are classes not long value or string value
since your data is prefixed with ip address and uses unfriendly not for example iso 8601 timestamp format getting the last element is not something you can expect
you could rely on empty lines as separators perhaps but that depends on how input files are structured and they could easily use semicolon instead
you can create an external table and set the location to the parquet files directory like below you have another option of loading the parquet files after creating the table what you are trying will also work you have to remove the wildcard character because it expects a path after the like parquet and looks for the files in the location
in your configuration spark is called in default mode yarn client probably and then your deploy mode and master as passed as app parameters because there are entered after jar file location
i haven t tried this because i have no environment to test it
a map method in contrast defines a function that is going to be executed on the executors meaning that it has to be serialized so that the executor can pick up the relevant data along with it and actually run it
you can imagine the hellish situations that could arise from having this object being serialized to the executors for their use
considerations it s recommended to only have two or three column families per table so you shouldn t implement this if you want to run this query for s5 s75 etc
it depends on exactly which queries you ll be running and how often you ll be running them
result other wise your way it will be nulltype not small int type thats the reason you are getting the exception
i also encountered the same issue and as explained by kosii above the root cause was not closing the htableinterface instance which i got from the htablepool after utilization
make your decision based on the following map reduce paradigm is used to solve the problem of handling large amount of data
there are likely some really good reasons for this but i m not qualified to speak to this issue
when one of these jobs finishes it renames the processed log files so that they are not processed again
problem related to namenode generally occurs due to misconfiguration of host or ip
because that comes defult change it to point on where your hdfs resides
my example with localhost for pseudo distributed mode next looking at your log it seems that most likely you re running using the local filesystem and you don t have the read write access to the directory where hbase stores its data check it with if your base rootdir is on hdfs you seem to have broken permissions so you will need to change it with or change the property dfs permissions to false in your hadoop home conf hdfs site xml
therefore any one mapper instance is most probably going to be processing a fair amount of data typical block size is 64 128 256 mb depending on your configuration in a sequential nature it will read the file block in its entirety from start to end
it is also unlikely that another mapper instance running on the same machine will want to process that data block again any time in the immediate future more so that multiple mapper instances will also be processing data alongside this mapper in any one tasktracker hopefully with a fair few being local to actually physical location of the data i e
the bootstrap action is executed simultaneously on all the master slave machines in the cluster so they will all have a local copy
this turns out to be really handy because the tests are invoked in debug mode and you can set breakpoints in your mappers and reducers and do all the cool things eclipse lets you do in debug
just as a side note i ve built a number of code generation tools based on the m2t jet project in eclipse
hbase also has hbasetestingutil which is great since you start hdfs and mapreduce in roughly two lines
still keeping the question open therefore
it also allows you to fine tune your dev ops since you can tear apart and start afresh with a new vm
since hadoop runs on linux environment you need to install cygwin on your windows machine which is a linux like environment for windows and will enable you to install and run linux based applications like hadoop on a windows machine
i had modified hive site xml so that the value of hive metastore warehouse dir is home hadoop data hive warehouse
finally i found the reason when kerberos use aes 256 encryption you should install jce
this is the reason why i can access hdfs on the machine within the hdfs cluster but can t on machine outside the hdfs cluster
therefore you have to do the following changes mapred output compress mapreduce output fileoutputformat compress mapred output compression codec mapreduce output fileoutputformat compress codec mapred output compression type mapreduce output fileoutputformat compress type
you can no longer query a at that point because it is no longer registered in the metastore
this does basically nothing because you already renamed a to a tmp
this will still print ok because there s nothing to do
you are also asking to populate it with the same data that is in a tmp which you already copied from a before so in short you re moving your initial table to a new one and then copying the new one back to the original so the only thing these query do is duplicating your initial data into both a and a tmp
this is because hadoop 1 0 and 2 0 are mostly incompatible so you should make sure to download the version of sqoop that matches your hadoop distribution
in this case you will require the following merges note that using merge strategies for class files may give problems caused by incompatible versions of that specific class
if that is the case then your problem is larger because then the dependencies are incompatible with each other
it allows to store result or part of it in a variable and use this variable later in your code
this error occures due to missing library hadoop hdfs jar in the classpath
since hdfs is reachable outside the project missing classes is the most likely problem
it seems i had to remove the header from the csv file because pig used the header row as data
so that was it
it is because the zookeeper watcher is null
java lang classnotfoundexception is because you want to run your class wikitest but it does not exist as it cannot be compiled
you re having the java lang classnotfoundexception because you are trying to use an external dependency in spark streamxmlrecordreader
turns out that the reason this was failing was because my code could not reach the datanode due to it being inside of a docker container and it s ip address being the internal docker container s ip address
that time 300 seconds means that once a tuple is emitted by a spout the topology has 300 seconds to process that tuple and all subsequent tuples that ripple through the topology through the three bolts as a result of that tuple
this means you either have to 1 increase the parallelism hint for the bolts so that there s no backlog slowing down the processing for any tuple emitted by the spout or 2 use the topology max spout pending property to limit the number of tuples the spout can emit before having to wait for one of those tuples to complete
extends row actions object results allows not only puts but also gets deletes increments put list put puts just do a batch of puts it also validates them client side
the association may be lost due to the java 8 excessive memory allocation issue https issues apache org jira browse yarn 4714 you can force yarn to ignore this by setting up the following properties in yarn site xml
as a result you will land up with under replicated blocks
so you should be able to put the file of 6 gb if 15 gb space is there because initially the original copies gets created on hadoop later on once the replication process will start then problem would get arise
actually we cannot see the hdfs directories directly so there are two methods to see the file in hdfs file system location 1st method is from terminal so that you can see the files in hdfs filesystem in cloudera named directory 2nd method is using the browser
based on the error it seems like you need git installed also this might be helpful for other errors https cwiki apache org confluence display tez build errors and solutions
reason you are running as root or with superuser permissions
hadoop 2 x allows you to set the map and reduce settings per job so you are setting the correct section
if yarn was killing off the containers for exceeding the memory when using the default settings then this means you need to give more memory to the off heap portion thus increasing the gap between xmx and the total map reduce memory mb
following error occurs because available resources for this job is null means no resources are available
this value is determined by the configuration parameter mapred reduce slowstart completed maps in mapred site xml which is by default set to 05 means reducers are not started till at least 5 of mappers are completed
following piece of code determines this value it means at least 1 mapper should have been completed because i guess your threshold is set to 5 and you have 20 mappers hence 5 of 20 1 before reducers can start
the yarn rm is unable to allocate any containers for your mappers hence not a single mapper is running
hence it uses these names interchangeably
i suspect it is because i have made these changes to the hadoopconfiguration aside from committing output directly to s3 these settings prevent creation of the metadata files which apparently are of no real use anyway and simply takes up a lot of time to create
we ran into a similar exception while trying to save directly the results of a run from apache spark version 1 5 2 to s3
this uses s3afastoutputstream instead of s3aoutputstream and uploads data directly from memory instead of first allocating local storage merging the results of the job to a single part before saving to s3 in spark that s called repartitioning coalescing some caveats though s3 s fast upload is apparently marked experimental in hadoop 2 7 this work around only applies to the newer s3a file system s3a
with s3a there is a parameter when you are getting the local file error it most likely because the buffer directory has no space
actually i was trying to rename file from data analytics raw folder csv part xxxxx to data analytics process folder csv part xxxxx where data analytics process was present in hdfs but folder csv was not present hence it was returning me false while renaming
before fs rename make check that file exists another cause may be that file which you try to rename is used by someone
to make sure that this is the root cause try to rename something else files in your code if this rename will be success the root cause is really in race condition
due to the metadata will be properly in the data catalog
looks like you re using spark 2 therefore sqlcontext and hivecontext should be replaced with sparksession sql after you enablehivesupport and instead of sql you can use sparksession table to get a dataframe of the entire table then follow it with a count then whatever other queries you want
as harold said but if you make sub queues inside for each user it can work but you have to manage it for each user we are small company and have few users so it manageable root 100 prod 70 user1 25 25 of the 70 user2 25 25 of the 70 user3 25 25 of the 70 user4 25 25 of the 70 i configured this scenario on our grid but still looking for a better approach
since we know that each record spans exactly 4 lines integer division of the index by 4 lets call this idx div
this will result in first four lines having 0 as idx div the next four lines will get 1 as idx div and so on
you should do this before calculating the max insert time that is in the cte your max also had an order by column so you were taking a cumulative max
i think the reason libjars option doesn t get recognized by your program is because you are not parsing it by calling genericoptionsparser getremainingargs
another option you can try since the libjars doesn t seem to be working for you is to package everything into a single jar ie your code the dependencies into a single jar
i had a similiar log system like yours the only difference is i actually analyze the logs not by date but by type so i would use to analyze that months logs for type1 and don t mix it with with type2
since you are analyzing not by type but by date i would recommend you to change your structure to so you can load the daily or monthly data then filter them by type would be more convenient
to test do this if you get permission denied you either need to change the permissions of this file so the hdfs user can read it or if it already has read permissions move the file to a directory that the hdfs user can read or use a different user that has permission to access the local and the remote directories files
based on the log i would guess that your java application that is executing sqoop do not have hadoop configuration on the classpath
thus sqoop won t get information about your cluster and will work in local mode
inside an evalfunc you can get a file from the hdfs via you might also consider putting the files into the distributed cache in that case you have to override getcachefiles in your evalfunc class
if you turn off speculative execution there is nothing stopping you manually creating the output folder structure files in your mapper and writing the records to them ignoring the output context collector for example extending the snippet setup method you could do something like this which is basically what multiple outputs is doing but assuming that speculative execution is turned off to avoid file collisions where two map tasks are trying to write to the same output file some points for consideration are the customerx yyyy mm dd paths files or folders of files if folders of files then you ll need to amend accordingly this implementation assumes that there is one file per date and the file name is yyyy mm dd you may wish to look into lazyoutputformat to prevent empty output map files being created
you could tweak the following properties as per your needs mapred min split size mapred max split size since you are dealing with small data setting mapred max split size to a lower value should do the trick
one has to edit kadm5 acl file and add below entry in kadm5 acl file here represents the wildcard so the user principal who matches the string as provided in kadm5 acl will be able to create any principal for example after changing configuration one need to restart the kerberos for taking the changes in effect
using sqoop2 1 99 6 and hadoop 2 7 1 i suffered this faith solution i tried the common loader property approach but for some reason i didn t get it right
since this problem is related to the fact that sqoop is not bein able to find automatically the hadoop configurations and libraries
the most common reason of observing such an error is a misconfigured value of io sort mb in your job
i checked the syslog for the particular map task which was failing which suggested that i was getting another exception in that task which was triggering this error
closer examination of the log for the failed task should give you the root cause for the issue
finally i find that the problem is caused by the fact that jni doesn t expand the wildcards in classpath
since this command hadoop classpath glob also will generate wildcards it explains that why the official document says this i misunderstood this paragraph yesterday
since https spark project atlassian net browse spark 1100 saveastextfile should never be able to silently overwrite an already existing folder
edit i think you are facing that error because all executors are trying to write to same same path which isn t available on all executors
if you have more than one node in the spark cluster the results will be mostly unusable each node will write some parts of the rdd to local disk
it originates from javascript object notation intended to cater for arrays objects and primitive types but more widespread usage means it has ambiguous mapping ha in other languages
the reason there were no errors while putting file and formatting namenode is that the master communicates to all the slaves and it has ip addresses for all of them
since slave s host file does not have their address judging by the posted hosts file for slaves it is giving an unknown host error
a big thanks to samson scharfrichter i checked the partitions
the hadoop streaming jar s location hadoop home share hadoop tools lib hadoop streaming 2 7 1 2 4 2 0 258 jar because the hadoop home is not same sometimes
the problem is that xpath function will return you all matching results per each request in independent arrays without joining them
they both webhdfs compatible so you don t need to change any rest api
you can do what she suggested or add to your classpath so that the hadoop hdfs client jar gets included at runtime
also you will need to use analytic window functions because hive does not support order by clause inside the collect list function
not sure what is cause but i copied to netty 4 1 17 final jar file to the hadoop library folder then the problem goes away
this suggestions reason is that when you start using spark in different situations these are the much more confusing errors and exception for the people are not so experienced
in each iteration k we re saying the number of paths from i to j is equal to the number of paths in prior iterations from i to j plus the number of paths from i to j via k thus break the graph in to n arbitrary sub adjacency matricies of size k x k compute above on each of them
paths can have anywhere between 1 edge and v 1 edges because you do not allow duplicate vertices in a path
the total number of paths is therefore p v v 2 sum i 1 v 1 prod k 1 i 1 v k 1 v 2 sum i 1 v 1 o v v o v 3 v v o v
there might be an algorithm that can count the paths without enumerating them and thus get a more efficient algorithm
you also have a problem in that your readfields method you call data readfields in on the writable interface but has no knowledge of the actual runtime class of data
i suggest you either write out the data class name before outputting the data object itself or look into the genericwritable class you ll need to extend it to define the set of allowable writable classes that can be used so you could amend as follows
since your code is only working with text chaining the default constructor in taggedwritable should do
this will try to load a file from the classpath neither the file in hdfs nor on the client local file system is part of the classpath at mapper reducer runtime so this is why you re seeing the null error the getresourceasstream returns null if the resource cannot be found
say c is a bag of items then c x will create a new bag of all of the x s in that bag
i ve finished some tests and found out the reason
since the default settings for dfs replication min is 1 i successfully wrote a file with dfs replication 3 to hdfs cluster of one node
the sad part is that you can t change dfs replication min per request so you can t improve reliability if it was set to lower layer
since you didn t mention any particular aspect of the contention beyond which stage it is in which makes me suspect you don t have much in the way of metrics of what is going on underneath
though paradoxically it can be your salvation as well so map output size is usually a key factor in the reduce copy problem
you may even be suffering from having too many mappers depending on what you are doing
this chews up memory so there is a real trade off involved in this parameter
io sort record percent this one is the least likely to be completely off the mark due to job size
usually if this is wrong it s because you have really big or really small records
this one always gets me in to trouble because my first instinct is to ramp it up really high and then i just create log jams in other places
you can really become disk bound and disk space bound so i ve found it helpful to change the path to be a comma delimited list of directories one for each drive
emr s one advantage is that you tend to get massive amounts of ram per node so you should spend some time making sure you use your ram optimally to minimize disk i o
you need to know this even if you re using the streaming api since the streaming itself is written using the old approach so when you want to alter some internals of the streaming mechanism with an external library you should be sure that this library was written using the old school way too
in common case you would write a wrapper but fortunately elephant bird provides an old styled inputformat so all you need is to replace com twitter elephantbird mapreduce input lzotextinputformat with com twitter elephantbird mapred input deprecatedlzotextinputformat
class taggedwritable doesn t have empty constructor so on the reduce phase when your serialized data should be read the app falls because it is impossible to create taggedwritable typed key via reflection
your map phase finishes successfully because on the map stage your mapper creates taggedwritable typed keys itself
this code solves the problem and gives the expected result
i tested on my box and it seems to work looks like this is still work in progress as described in hdfs 3557 it seems to be specific to 0 20 2 if you re using cloudera this still affects cdh3u versions so you d probably need to use cdh4
but i think you re going to run into problems in a fully distributed environment as the distcp command runs a map reduce job so the destination path will be interpreted as local to each cluster node
your mappers read the text file and apply the following map function on every line all map calls emit the key 1 which will be processed by one single reduce function since you re using hadoop you probably have seen the use of stringtokenizer in the map function you can use this to get only the time in one line
by specifying a combiner this combiner is then executed on the results of all map functions of the same machine i e without networking in between
since you want to take the average of all times not grouped by process name or anything you will have a single fixed key
thus your mapper would look something like your reducer takes these values and simply computes the average
you can post process the output of the job written a single file or since you re computing a single value you can store the result in a counter for example
so my command line should have ended n agent and not n apache agent since my flume conf file specifies agent x after that everything appears to work
in the config file you specified so the agent name is agent flume expects that while running the flume agent you should use the same name as specified in the config file so the command should be
since you know the xpath s of what you want e g
map your xml to avro as described here because a serde exists for seamless avro to hive mapping
it depends on your level of experience and comfort with these approaches
for our single node setup of hadoop we therefore need to configure ssh access to localhost for the user
this can be done using the following commands open the file and enter the following content in between the configuration configuration tag format the new hadoop filesystem now the hadoop file system needs to be formatted so that we can start to use it
the format command should be issued with write permission since it creates current directory under usr local hadoop store folder or hadoop setup is done now start the hdfs check url http localhost 50070 for stopping hdfs
we mainly depend on hdfs api for our application
today we depend on the following core libraries
in addition to these we depend on test libraries too
based on your needs you may want to include hadoop hdfs and hadoop mapreduce client to the dependencies along with hadoop common
also in a hadoop 2 x project using the hadoop 1 x dependency gives an error like thus it is suggested not to use it
since i already have an example ready i ll just copy it here
so essentially multiple mappers were trying to write the same file because of the same file name like abc def even though the files were actually different
so it is possible to read non serializable types into an rdd i e
in spark if you try to use a third party class which is not serializable it throws notserializable exception it s because of the closure property of spark i e whatever instance variable which are defined outside the transformation operation you try to access inside a transformation operation spark tries to serialize it as well as all the dependent classes of that object
you can either configure hbase hregion max filesize in hbase site xml file or as d argument to higher value may be according to your input file size so that number of hfiles created will be less
you can download these files from the following blog http www srccodes com p article 39 error util shell failed locate winutils binary hadoop binary path thanks to abhijit ghosh for building those files for windows and sharing them otherwise you would have to build them yourself
to hbase home bin edit the hbase home conf hbase env cmd find the line set hbase opts xx useconcmarksweepgc djava net preferipv4stack true and add the following option at the end dhadoop home dir c hbase 0 98 5 hadoop2 where c hbase 0 98 5 hadoop2 is your hbase home directory so that it will become as follows set hbase opts xx useconcmarksweepgc djava net preferipv4stack true dhadoop home dir c hbase 0 98 5 hadoop2 good luck
for example if the desired absolute path is d tmp hdp then it would look like this the reason this works is that the default values for many of the hdfs directories are configured to be file hadoop tmp dir suffix
it s important to use instead of because a bare unencoded character is not valid in url syntax
there are so many reasons to what may lead to the problem i faced
before posting my answer i want to rephrase the question based on my understanding to make sure i understand the question correctly as follows you have tbs of data that fits the relational db model well and you want to query the data using sql most of the time i think that s why you put it into greenplum db but sometimes you want to use spark and mapreduce to access the data because of their flexibility
some features of hawq make it fit your requirements perfectly note i may be biased since i am a developer of hawq
different from the dbinputformat provided by hadoop which would make the master become the performance bottleneck since all the data goes through the master first hawq inputformat for mapreduce lets your spark and mapreduce code access the hawq data stored in hdfs directly
it is totally distributed and thus is very efficient
since you don t care to mention which version of hadoop and which version of oozie you are using i will assume a recent setup e g
and since you don t mention which kind of interface you use command line
oozie jobs localtime len 10 filter name crazyexperiment shows the last 10 executions of crazyexperiment workflow so that you can inject the appropriate job id in next commands
because this code does not create a table this will only use a table that already exists
to save partitioned dataset you can use either dataframewriter partitionby available since spark 1 6 df write partitionby somecolumn format save dataframewriter bucketby available since spark 2 0 df write bucketby somecolumn format save using df partitionby somecolumn write format save should work as well but dataset api doesn t use hashcodes
it uses murmurhash so results will be different than the results from hashparitioner in rdd api and trivial checks like the one you described won t work
for example and load the data like location data y 2016 m 02 d 03 h 03 hh 12 data avro location data y 2016 m 02 d 03 h 03 hh 13 data2 avro in that way you will be able to load the data with the following statement because hive will recognize the partitions if you don t want to do this you can use the add partition like
but this is not java if you run the version command argument with it you get below result plus if you find the file var tmp w conf open the file and you can see the monero wallet server he is using his wallet address and password etc
arg1 string to process arg2 key value pair separator arg3 key value separator the result of str to map will give you a map str str of 3 key value pairs
in particular in that case the output would be a cross product between all ages and names due to the last two flatten calls
then if the value in the limit is n there would be n 2 output rows instead of intended n much safer is to do the following in the generate line which would give exactly the same result as the accepted answer when limit 1 is used
because anything is ok
it s obviously something that will have to be digested by me and others so i won t have any snappy advice in the short term
i also encountered same problem in my case it was giving exception because i haven t closed sequencefile writer object
infact it was not filtering success file automatically and due to reading this log file exception mentioned in the question was occuring
forgot to set java home in etc hadoop hadoop env sh may also cause this error
since cognos can extract data from an odbc database it stands to reason that cognos can extract data from hadoop through hive
if you see the runjar class the arguments supported are where jarfile is accessed using the following code inside runjar class hence filename points to jarfile so filename in my view cannot be a hdfs path as seen above unless you are somehow able to mount the hdfs in your file system so that it becomes accessible by the java file class
just emit two records for each pair like this at reducer side you ll get 4 different groups like this now you are good to format your result as you want
let me know if anybody can see any issue in this approach
here is an example for the problem in question map 1 2 list 1 2 null however some more operations need to be done so that the keys are grouped and partitioned appropriately and we achieve the correct result in the reducer
due to the fact that hadoop runs in a cluster with many nodes it is important to ensure that there as many reduce tasks as partitions
in our case what we need to do is compute the partition that a synthetic key belongs based on the hash value of the real key before the comma
finally we must remember to include the following in our main class so that the framework uses our classes
the key about my aproach is that it never needs all friends in memory at the same moment so it works also in the really big situations
can be caused by a broken disk as well
in my case it was not so broken so that ambari hdfs or our monitoring services noticed it but broken enough so that it couldn t serve one region
first of all namenode stores metadata in memory so the amount of files and blocks you might have is limited 100m blocks is a max for typical server
by default spark starts on yarn with 2 executors num executors with 1 thread each executor cores and 512m of ram executor memory giving you only 2 threads with 512mb ram each which is really small for the real world tasks so my recommendation is start spark with num executors 4 executor memory 12g executor cores 4 which would give you more parallelism 16 threads in this particular case which means 16 tasks running in parallel use sc wholetextfiles to read the files and then dump them into compressed sequence file for instance with snappy block level compression here s an example of how this can be done http 0x0fff com spark hdfs integration
i think you have an error in your command note queuename one word and the order based on the documentation vm args need to go directly after the import
therefore yarn uses a clumsy workaround it periodically checks how much ram each container uses and kills brutally anything that got over quota
a java scala utility or custom program so you can get away by setting your own jvm quotas especially xmx so that you always stay under the yarn limit
which means some wasted ram because of the safety margin
but then the worse case is an clean failure of the jvm when it s out of memory you get the execution logs in extenso and can start adjusting the quotas or fixing your memory leaks so what happens in your specific case
that s because that link only contains spark specific configuration
first off you shouldn t be writing into the user folder directly nor set 777 on it you re going to need a user directory for your current user to even run a mapreduce job so you need to sudo su hdfs first to become an hdfs superuser
if you observe your hdfs dfs ls result you see that only hdfs super user have the permissions to that path
more on acls this is so basic and important for you to learn try the above suggested ones and let me know if those don t work i can help more based on the error you get
the issue was due to the cross realm referrals support for kerberos jdk 8215032
assuming you don t want to run spark on yarn start from bundle spark 2 4 5 with hadoop 2 7 then cherry pick the hadoop libraries to upgrade from bundle hadoop 2 10 x discard spark yarn hadoop yarn hadoop mapreduce client jars because you won t need them except hadoop mapreduce client core that is referenced by write operations on hdfs and s3 cf
mr commit procedure v1 or v2 you may also discard spark mesos mesos and or spark kubernetes kubernetes jars depending on what you plan to run spark on you may also discard spark hive thriftserver and hive jars if you don t plan to run a thrift server instance except hive metastore that is necessary for as you might guess managing the metastore either a regular hive metastore service or an embedded metastore inside the spark session discard hadoop hdfs hadoop common hadoop auth hadoop annotations htrace core xercesimpl jars replace with hadoop hdfs client hadoop common hadoop auth hadoop annotations htrace core xercesimpl stax2 api jars from hadoop 2 10 under common and common lib or hdfs and hdfs lib add the s3a connector from hadoop 2 10 i e
hadoop aws jets3t woodstox core jars under tools lib download aws java sdk from amazon cannot be bundled with hadoop because it s not an apache license i guess and finally run a lot of tests that worked for me after some trial and error with a caveat i ran my tests against an s3 compatible storage system but not against the real s3 and not against regular hdfs
for the record the process is the same with spark 3 0 0 previews and hadoop 3 2 1 except that you also have to upgrade guava you don t have to upgrade xercesimpl nor htrace core nor stax2 api you don t need jets3t any more you need to retain more hadoop mapreduce client jars probably because of the new s3 committers
have you checked out the effect of set hive enforce bucketing true
thus it requires a global sort step to satisfy the query you are looking for
since it s based on rest api any language can access it and also hadoop need not be installed on the node on which the hdfs files are required
hence you need to remove the white spaces
this seems like a typical sqoop import to hive job so it seems like sqoop has successfully imported data in hdfs and is failing to load that data into hive
since this is theoretically running from any node in your hadoop cluster hive cli will need to be available on each node and talk to the same metastore
the most normal problem is because sqoop cannot talk to the correct metastore
the main reasons for this are normally hive metastore service is not running
if you are using cdh then problem may be due to hive metastore jar dependency conflicts
i ve actually duplicated a vm to create the slave machines which lead to a situation where all nodes had same uuid
authentication also depend in the time stamp client address and some other information based on the implementation
a summary of the same is as follows kerberos is s a trusted third party authentication protocol designed for tcp ip networks which is based on symmetric cryptography
the tgs then is responsible for authenticating this client for access to the actual server
if your input is something like this your reduce output will be since it assumes everything as the same key
i m not a flink user but based on what i ve seen with spark friends my guess is that authenticated on all worker nodes means that each worker process has a core site xml config available on local fs with hadoop security authentication set to kerberos among other things the local dir containing core site xml added to the classpath so that it is found automatically by the hadoop configuration object it will revert silently to default hard coded values otherwise duh implicit authentication via kinit and the default cache tgt set globally for the linux account impacts all processes duh or implicit authentication via kinit and a private cache set thru krb5ccname env variable hadoop supports only file type or explicit authentication via usergroupinformation loginuserfromkeytab and a keytab available on the local fs that ugi login method is incredibly verbose so if it was indeed called before flink tries to initiate the hdfs client from the configuration you will notice
that big listfiles change moves the enum of files under a path from a recursive treewalk to a series of flat lists of all child entries under a path it works fantastically for everything else distcp tests hive spark and has been shipping in products since dec 16 i d be somewhat surprised if it is the cause but not denying blame
both flink s3 fs hadoop and flink s3 fs presto register default filesystem wrappers for uris with the s3 scheme flink s3 fs hadoop also registers for s3a and flink s3 fs presto also registers for s3p so you can use this to use both at the same time
for that i used therefore follow below steps and modify database like mysql as per your requirement also if you change directories the metastore db created above won t be found
using centos 6 5 the cloudera manager special files do not show up in a search files result because their permissions are set to hide from all but the hdfs user
so your failure is the fact that mrunit is using the equals and hashcode methods of the objects to compare the expected and actual output objects a hashmap is used in the org apache hadoop mrunit testdriver buildpositionmap list pair k2 v2 method immutablebyteswritable does implement an equals and hashcode method put doesn t implement an equals or hashcode method so the put is what s causing the problem
the only way around this is to manually check the driver output use the driver run method rather than runtest and compare the result list to what you re expecting using the objects compareto method which does exist for both classes
good enough solution for this case happened to be based on checkandput method
standard java java util uuid class contains everything i need including it is based on somewhat slow but pretty strong java security securerandom generator
just note it looks like hbase user row locking feature is going to be dropped due to security other risks related to its usage
that is a mandatory step because the data has to be persisted before it can be moved from the map task to a reducer the two can run on separate nodes in general
so while reading the files it was throwing an out of memory exception and may be for this reason it was getting an empty string and throwing can not create a path from an empty string exception
bottomline one possible cause for this exception is running out of memory
my hive log file showed the cause see the first line in the snippet below where one of the jar file uris contains file without any path in my case the issue was caused by a badly configured hive home conf hive env sh file where hive aux jars path contained a reference to an environment variable that was not set
the winutils exe will be in that same location the hadoop common target bin but the code looks for it based on hadoop home so you ll have to define that
i intentionally omitted the details how to configure all these because i don t think you should or to be more precise you should only if you understand how to do it
you can locate a version files in your home pushuser1 hadoop tmp dfs data current datanode directory as well as namenode directory home pushuser1 hadoop tmp dfs name current based on the value your specified for dfs namenode name dir that contains the clusterid
add these entries in your spark home conf spark defaults conf spark driver extrajavaoptions dhdp version 2 2 0 0 2041 your installed hdp version spark yarn am extrajavaoptions dhdp version 2 2 0 0 2041 your installed hdp version create java opts file in spark home conf and add the installed hdp version in that file like dhdp version 2 2 0 0 2041 your installed hdp version to know hdp verion please run command hdp select status hadoop client in the cluster
to check what you currently have run this command ip addr show eth0 an example output would be like this eth0 broadcast multicast up lower up mtu 9001 qdisc pfifo fast state up qlen 1000 in this case mtu is 9001 so you need to change it to 1500 by running sbin ifconfig eth0 mtu 1500 up
adjusting the mtu didn t help so i kept digging and found that the error is linked to tcp timeouts
you should choose your solution based on what is easier for you maybe prefer the first option for now
as soon as you start running your spark job on a real cluster it is far better to not hardcode the master parameter so that you can run your spark job in multiple cluster mode yarn mesos standalone with spark submit and still keep it running locally with netbeans dspark master local
applying distinct to each dataset before joining them is safer because joining not unique keys will duplicate data
try running both queries and compare results
they are hive configuration properties that must be defined before creating the hivecontext object either in the hive site xml available to spark at launch time or in your code by re creating the sparkcontext sc getconf get orc compress undefined depends on hadoop conf sc stop val scalt new org apache spark sparkcontext new org apache spark sparkconf set orc compress snappy scalt getconf get orc compress undefined will now be snappy val hivecontextalt new org apache spark sql sqlcontext scalt edit with spark 2 x the script would become spark sparkcontext getconf get orc compress undefined depends on hadoop conf spark close val sparkalt org apache spark sql sparksession builder config orc compress snappy getorcreate sparkalt sparkcontext getconf get orc compress undefined will now be snappy issue 2 spark uses its own serde libraries for orc and parquet json csv etc so it does not have to honor the standard hadoop hive properties
the fix for me was to add this line in hadoop env sh thats because java activation package is deprecated in java 9
no need to edit any config files with this method since it will automatically be added to the classpath
when the input data is huge or when too many jobs are submitted from the same client then because of the input split calculations the job submission might become a bit slow
in yarn every job gets its own application master so no worries about overloading a spof bottleneck master like job tracker
based on those locations client directly contacts with datanodes for those blocks
and finally client reads all those blocks in same order manner those blocks were stored here namenode returns the addresses of all the blocks of a file to the client in hdfs resulting in complete file to the client
hdfs is a non posix compliant file systems so you can t edit files directly inside of hdfs however you can copy a file from your local system to hdfs using following command hdfs dfs put path in source system filename path in hdfs system destination
got it i was facing this issue because of the hue directory ownership
i have found that this kind of dns issues can cause quite a bit of confusion
many thanks to robert j berger to leading me to the answer to the same issue
i wasn t having issue 1 but i was having issue 2 with the server reporting however his answer was focusing on the master side so i d thought i d expand on his with my own answer
it was due to how the etc hosts file was being built on the regionserver nodes as they were getting issued
writing a native yarn apps may be a little awkward because hadoop yarn project doesn t have a higher level framework to help with this
however there are few projects which are doing the heavy lifting so that user would not have a need to worry about this boilerplate code
this issue occur due to abrupt termination of hive shell
as you already know a cartesian product is not allowed in strict mode and for good reasons
the result will be the cartesian product since it will match each row of table1 with each row of table2
there is exact explanation how to add node http wiki apache org hadoop faq i have a new node i want to add to a running hadoop cluster 3b how do i start services on just one node 3f in the same time i am not sure that already running jobs will take advantages of these nodes since planning where to run each task happens during job start time as far as i understand
this is because you can set output directory when you write so it can be determined only when needed
es is a search analytic engine or data aggregation platform allowing you to say index the result of your hadoop job for search purposes
i was asking myself the same question and i think this almost answers our question for now so it depends on your use case so much text analysis elk so much aggregations and calculations spark although it s blurry reference https thecustomizewindows com 2017 02 apache hadoop spark vs elasticsearch elk stack
you cannot use it because its not present there the spark version that you are using is 1 6 and sparksession was introduced in 2 0 0
there s no de facto list that i ve found of exactly what you need and don t need and it is painfully dependent on your cluster configuration
the surefire way is to have a copy of your hbase configurations in your classpath since your client can be anywhere as you mentioned
ps no need in this because hbaseconfiguration has
the delimiter you are using is the cause for errors
the data file will work correctly because the classes agree with what you specify but the index file will throw the classcastexception because the index file values are all longwritables
you have two options you can start using the org apache hadoop mapreduce version of sequencefileinputformat thus changing other parts of your code which does know enough about mapfiles to just look at the data file or instead you can explicitly give the data file as the file you want as input
when i added the creds into conf hive site xml i didn t notice the pre existing username password elements so when i added my own they weren t used and i ended up with the same nondescript message as above
if you run the metatool command it stack traces and you get this which in my case pointed to the real cause
but the error message you paste doesn t contain sufficient information to locate the exact cause of the problem
indeed there are quite a lot reasons which may lead to this error as the answers posted by other authors each relate to a specific aspect
my suggestion is run hive service metastore command to get a more detailed and targeted error message and then address the problem accordingly
i m using oracle for the hive metastore therefore cp oracle home jdbc lib ojdbc6 jar hive home lib ojdbc6 jar
it is because of the change in font or character set used in the document from where it was copied
for example if you copy paste and execute the command hdfs dfs put workflow xml testfile workflow xml you may get or this happens because the copy is done from a utf 8 file and the or u or any of the characters copied may be of different character set
hyphens differ from dashes only in that they are a tad longer so the mistake is hard to spot but since they are a completely different character the command is wrong that is not found
if you run ddl commands it may again give you the could not instantiate hivemetastoreclient error now copy back the db lck1 to db lck and dbex lck1 to dbex lck log out from all hive shell and hdfs instances relogin and you should see your old tables note step 5 may seem a little weird because even after deleting the lock entry it will still give the hivemetastoreclient error but it worked for me
if the data is public you will not need an aws access or secret key because you will not use the s3n variant
the root cause of the problem is you get many text infos from hadoop before you can receive the data
therefore you should skip this unneccesary infos
in my case i have to skip 86 lines therefore my one line command will be this for counting the records hdfs dfs cat hdfs hdm1 gphd local 8020 hive gphd warehouse my db my part m 00000 gz tail n 86 zcat wc l note this is a workaround not a real solution and very ugly because of 86 but it works fine
a simple way to unzip uncompress a file within hdfs for whatever reason
i speculate this works because hadoop automatically uncompresses gzipped files under the hood and cat is just echoing that unzipped output
since when you can use ssh localhost without any problem the thing you need to do next is giving execution permission to your scripts
for us this was caused by running beyond physical memory limits
i found that for some reason the call to send self request stream false timeout none verify true cert none proxies none is passed a timeout of 0 and that causes send to throw a maxretryerror bottom line i found if you just set timeout 1 it works fine hdfs pywebhdfsclient host yourhost port 50070 user name hdfs timeout 1 hope this works for you as well
run below command to see if the webhdfs port works from your host please note if ssl is enabled then port would be 50470 hdfs namenode format should not run from the node because it formats your namenode and you loose everything
it has a rudimentary dependency scheduler so it will order and execute your jobs for you
have you tried partitions or indexes partition can greatly speed up group by as the data is physically divided over the nodes by partition and therefore the reduce operations are greatly reduced and in some cases instant
again if you have too many reducers then there s too much data being shuffled around resulting in increase in network traffic
another way is to kill the proccess which occupy the port which may cause another service crash
if all the blocks of input data files are in that node the scheduler with prioritize the same node
in this case i d say it was because the output from the mapper is not being piped into the reducer as it is when you run the commands manually one way to fix this would be to output to a temporary file from map and then use the temporary file in reduce
as you said it in comments it seems your project is not data intensive but computing intensive thus i think mapreduce is not the tool you need to use
performance of mapreduce systems strongly depends on an even data distribution
an adaptive load balancing strategy is required to address the problem of estimating the cost of the tasks that are distributed to the reducers based on a given cost model
partitions do not have statics ranges because there will be space areas which do not have much information
probably caused by system resource issue i fixed it by restarting my system
thus use the hostname in the config files
this issue might be due to the missing hadoop conf dir which is needed by the mapreduce application to connect to the resource manager which is mentioned in yarn site xml
try running it with the option master yarn cluster depending on the size of the data you may have allocate more memory per container by adding more numbers to the following config parameters yarn nodemanager resource memory mb yarn scheduler maximum allocation mb spark submit master yarn client num executors 5 driver cores 8 driver memory 50g executor memory 44g code to run py
each mapper then receives a line of the temporary random nodes file a random node and parses the graph file and configuration files so it performs the required operations
since i don t have experience in hadoop i m not sure if this is the proper way to do it or just a nasty workaround but i think this answer could hel others with the same problem
when the worker node trying to find the path of the file we need to load into spark it fails because the worker doesn t have such file
the last redirect statement can be omitted or changed based on your requirement
i assume you won t have that problem because you are still in importing project
i ran into this thread cause the error log changed on src filesystem i met this issue and skipped it by modify yarn src code
to learn more about memory optimizations please see memory management overview also see following thread on so container is running beyond memory limits cheers
because by then it is apparently already too late and the configuration is ignored
also as this so question answered the current hive version supported by spark is 2 1
as strange as it sounds the use of the single tic to enclose your connection string may be causing problems
but inputformats that read from hbase database do not read from files so you could make your own implementation of the inputformat and define your own behaviour in getsplits recordreader createrecordreader
i guess your are looking to test your map reduce on samll set of data so in that case i will recommand following unit test for map reduce will solve your problem if you want to test your mapper combiner reducer for a single line of linput from your file best possible thing is to use unittest for each
sample code using mocking frame work in java use can run these test cases in your ide here i have used mockito or mrunit can also be used which too is depended on a mockito java mocking framework
i know i m resurrecting an old thread but there was no best answer chosen so i thought i d throw this out there
as a result you may loose information and face some problems on machine restart
it is not a big deal for two reasons you do io which is slow so it won t be a big deal to create a few new objects per input line and let it be garbage collected
so if you create objects they will be stored in heap memory as long as a certain memory threshold will be exceeded so it is likely that your other solution takes more heap memory than the other
if you now lower your heap memory the garbage collector must run more often because the threshold exceeds more often
another reason might be the way you are measuring the time a map task involves a lot of rpc communication in the back so you can t always be 100 sure that your data isn t skewed by network congestion or other environmental effects
reuse variable is theoretically better but based on amdahl s law http en wikipedia org wiki amdahl 27s law the improvement may be even not noticeable
the lease is dropped because the client has dropped the connection due to the ioexception while reading the file
just deserialize the treeset from the file and use the methods to search based on the key
fetch failures are often due to dns problems
because of how the files are divided into blocks the system runs out of memory pretty quickly
so to solve this you have to fill the blocks and arrange your new files so that they are spread nicely into blocks
hadoop lets you archive small files so that they are correctly allocated into blocks
more information would be required to get the real cause
finally i figured out it is due to one missing at etc ssh sshd config you shoud add authorizedkeysfile h ssh authorized keys so that sshd will look for the publickey file at your home dir
to compile mahout to work with 2 x since it isn t released in a package that is compatible with hadoop 2 x if you want to confirm after the build that the correct dependencies were brought in run the following from the root of the project the artifacts generated by the above command differ from what s in the 0 9 release so you ll need to update more than just the version number there seems to be a new mahout mrlegacy jar
error is due to hadoop cannot find the jars on place
infact my problem was based on the command to start the process even if this is the officially documented way provided by the apache hadoop project
also do you know the reason for the crash
the map mb size you re looking at is irrelevant since you re not starting a map reduce check all the memory related yarn settings it might be that your minimal allocation for containers is too high
it s failing because you must ve enabled vmem check
it seems like zookeeper is very sensitive to timing and timeout issues so increase the default tick numbers for timeout that should help
the negative effect of this is that your dns may not auto detect corrupted block files and would need to wait upon a future block reading client to detect them instead this isn t a big deal if your average replication is 3 ish but you can consider the change as a short term one until you upgrade to a release that fixes the issue
exclude hadoop mapreduce client app and hadoop mapreduce client jobclient because they try to provide a service which cannot start due to missing dependencies in wildfly
if you rely on jackson 2 you need to package the whole hadoop client into an own ear because hadoop client enforces jackson 1 via an packaged provider
this error occurs due to adding of assembly jar which which contains classes from icl over slf4j jar which is causing the stdout messages and slf4j log4j12 jar
in your classes path which causes the jvm to load search class jar files available in your current working directory as well
different thoughts to resolve the issue first thought was two threads was working on same piece because of nn intelligence
finally the root cause lies in a application layer code itself
in hive exec 2 1 0 version they introduced new configuration property hive exec stagingdir hive staging description of above property so if there is any concurrent jobs in application layer code etl and are doing operation rename delete move on same table then it may lead to this problem
and in our case 2 concurrent jobs are doing insert overwrite on same table that leads to delete metadata file of 1 mapper that is causing this issue
particularly in the hivemetastoreutils java file the following declaration seems to be cause of the execution error thus changing the values for the mentioned in the metastore is not enough as the code constraint will throw the exception
the fs rm r is single threaded while distcp runs in parallel based on mappers
fs rm will move to hdfs trash so you re not actually deleting any records just moving them
and if would recommend that you purge in batches for example remove all files starting with letter a getmerge downloads all records to your local machine so you better be sure you have enough disk space the only way to merge within hdfs is a mapreduce or spark task
it depends on your file formats but filecrush is a library you could look into
in my case the timeline service v2 couldn t start because there was not enough memory on the system
i found through the more detailed error logs that it was giving an insufficient memory error so when i upped the vm memory to 4gb it was able to run
it seems like something around 4gb is required depending on how many services you re running on the main namenode
a ctas create table as select with your example this ctas could work you cannot have primary key or foreign keys on hive as you have primary key on rbdmss like oracle or mysql because hive is schema on read instead of schema on write like oracle so you cannot implement constraints of any kind on hive
i can not give you the exact answer because of it suppose to you must try to do it by yourself and then if you have a problem or a doubt come here and tell us
hive is not an rdbms database so there is no concept of primary key or foreign key
inserting a document should also cause some change to the search weight indexes
if you can get a scala job into a jar file not sure since i ve not used scala before and am a jvm n00b it d be a simply matter to send it along and write a bit of a wrapper to run it on the map reduce cluster
since this package is somewhat misleading with hive hadoop data ware house
well hadoop data ware house which is hive is basically if you are interested in some subset of results which should run through subset of data which you normally do using sql queries
moreover you need not worry whether hadoop is running on pseudo mode or cluster mode since hive needs to be installed only on namenode not on the data nodes
as far as duplication of effort hive is meant to be a complete sql implementation on top of hadoop so there is duplication in as much as both sql and r can both work with text data but not in as much as both are specific tools with different strengths
this way you ll be able to exclude some neighbours based on some business constraints or whatever but you ll always work with only the list of possible neighbours for every given index not with the whole input set now in the reducer you will get as you can notice you don t need the artificial 1 count any more as for the doesexist test you can now check if any wrapper bean in the values list has the same index as the key index
if it was correct of course however the question is whether the deletion of edges will lead to a disconnected graph
depending on what you want to optimize either time or messsage complexity or any other perfomance metric you will find different algorithms
thomas answer would allow heterogeneous lists except that since the generic type would preclude you ever creating one and i o is almost always the bottleneck in hadoop i don t recommend that strategy
you have to write the classname within each record which is really verbose so i recommend you to strong type that
update the permission problem is because the oozie job is running as the mapred user yet the file only has rwx permissions for the user ambari qa and group hdfs i would either amend the file permissions on the file and parent folder such that the mapred user can delete replace the file or look into masquerading as a user that does have the correct permissions
replace hostname port with logicaljt and everything should just work as long as the node from which you re running oozie has the appropriate hdfs site and mapred site configs properly installed implicitly due to being part of the cluster or explicitly due to adding a gateway role to it
with this solution you will not need to implement the hadoop interface since this is a direct bridge between cassandra and spark
as you can see here this is caused because a generic unhandled exception is being thrown in the cassandra s cql recordreader
try to run spark with debug logging enabled and you should get the error that is causing this issue
a straightforward approach would be to run the hdfs data through pig to filter out the headers and generate a new hdfs dataset formatted so that impala could read it cleanly
a more arcane approach would depend on the format of the hdfs data
as chirag points out with mr you get more low level control and thus more potential for optimization
i d also like to add pig and hive are more for scripts and thus more volatile and harder to debug
in fact scalding is basically the most concise framework you can get more concise than pig and hive mainly by virtue of it being in scala
this is an old question but the partition column has to be case sensitive because of the unix filesystem on which it gets stored
path collumnname value is always different from path collumnname value in unix so it should be considered a bad practice to rely on case insensitive column names for hive
this is basically a server endpoint responsible for bringing the files required to run a container onto the local node
with ambari 2 2 hdp2 3 4 0 i m seing the same issue python script has been killed due to timeout after waiting 1800 secs can be solved by setting the timeout agent package install task timeout 1800 in etc ambari server conf ambari properties paul
when the response from these servers are taking too much time causes this error
additionally because i was calling the athena create table statement by passing in the statement from a json file i had to add an extra to mask the original in json
code and finally note while generating pairs i sort the tuple because we don t want the order of users in a list to matter
this problem occurs because beeline s use of failed connection s causes failures and leaks all error reproducing how it is solved and which versions are containing the fix are included in this link
troubleshooting steps open the file pig cmd in any editor like notpad notepad look for the line set hadoop bin path hadoop home bin replace this with set hadoop bin path hadoop home libexec what we did was that hadoop config cmd file was not being found by pig so we pointed it with the correct one
obviously this only works when the spark history server runs with the hadoop classes in its classpath so it s not an out of the box solution for a smack stack for example
since you are writing back to a distributed fs hdfs it would be able to write in parallel by spawning required specified number of reducers
it is for this reason that there is a reduce step in the query execution plan
please read the comments on the question mairbek khadikov and my discussion on this conclude the actual reason of the issue
i corrected the core site xml file based on standard commands and it works fine now
i think this is caused by the combination of userclasspathfirst and usr lib hadoop hadoop common jar being the jar dataproc specifies to spark submit
below shell script will give you desired result
i have written this below simplified shell script to get the result step 1 replace the db name column name in below script and run step 2 run the below command note remember to clear the variable output in case you are running multiple times
if you check the code on https github com apache nutch blob release 2 3 1 src java org apache nutch fetcher fetcherjob java l119 l124 nutch is only logging that is skipping that url because it was already fetched
since nutch works in batches in needs to check all the urls on the same batchid but if you specify the resume flag then only on debug will log that it is skipping certain urls
even knowing the last url its not enough because you would also need the position of that url in the batch
the error is due to trying to run multiple spark contexts at teh same time
the solution to your problem is therefore to make sure that the same sparkcontext is used everywhere
furthermore let me quote the documentation the conclusion is you should adjust the parameter accordingly to the expected amount of data and desired parallelism
depending on your actual data usage mysql or postgres should be able to handle a couple of billion records on the right hardware
take google for example there didn t really exist a storage search solution that satisfied their needs so they created their own based on a map reduce model
there may have been improvements on that front since i looked at the issue about a year and a half ago
the backend will depend on the data and how the data will be accessed
couchdb will help you a lot when it comes to partitioning sharding your data and like seems like it might fit with your project especially if your data format might change in the future adding or removing fields since couchdb databases have no schema
there are plenty of optimizations in couchdb for read heavy apps as well and based on my experience with it is where it really shines
even in that case the hostname fqdn should return as localhost
using a too high value would cause problems on the db side while using a too low value would not give you ideal performance
the apache sqoop v1 doc page for users of the export tool also lists down a set of common reasons for the failure of the export job
that s because your firewall is on
the exception log mentioned tha the failure reason is no route to host
one thing to note is that if there a are say 1k mappers and each of them will try to open the non hdfs file this might lead to a bottle neck based on the type of the external file system
the reason this is happening is that sqoop writes files to a temporary directory when in incremental mode
before issuing the job set the system property that sqoop relies on as the base for the temporary files see appendutils also when renaming the files sqoop gets a handle on the fs by getting the default fs from the hadoop config so you ll also need to set this to s3n it s not pretty but it works
hadoop does not rely on kerberos to authenticate running tasks for instance but uses its own tokens that were issued based on the kerberos tickets
as jacob mentioned you will not get a valid blockaccesstoken unless the user has the permissions to access the data based on the file system permissions assuming that you have secure hadoop cluster
both mappers are executed parallel so you don t need to worry about reducer output because both mappers output will be shuffled so that equal keys from both the files go to same reducer
however due to the lack of a guarantee that the mappers will run concurrently ensure that the functionality of your mapreduce jobs is not reliant on their concurrent execution
there should not be any issue in configuring and running hadoop and hbase on mac
i have been doing this since quite sometime without any issue
this is only the start to a solution based on your feedback we might make things more concrete this link provides a tutorial to write your own xmlinputformat which you can customize to look for exception characteristics
the main point of this tutorial is this sentence i will copy paste the information of the website since it might go offline in the future which could be very frustrating for people reviewing this in the future the inputformat the record reader note the logic for reading past the end of the split is in readuntilmatch function which reads past the end of the split if the there is an open tag
the textinputformat will split the file by line so if the exception ends with a newline and contains none within it this should work
in that case i recommend looking for mahout s xmlinputformat
then i find actually the linerecordreader has alreadly had some logic to read record spaning a inputsplit boundary cause line records in the bottom of the split always be splitted into 2 different split due to size limitation of block
i can t help you with that since you need to tweak it to your cluster topology
one of the major issues that a lot of people are running into these days is that the amount of ram available to java applications has exploded but most of the information about tuning java gc is based on experience from the 32 bit era
to accomplish that you can either increase it s size so it takes longer to fill up or increase the tenuring threshold essentially the number young collections the object will stay for
this is because if it finds a namenode uri instead of logical uri then it will create non ha file system which will try to use simple ugi instead of kerberos ugi
first case 50 files are merged into final 5 and then they are directly fed into reduce phase total rounds is 5 1 6 second case 34 files are merged into final 4 and the remaining 6 are directly read from in memory and fed into the reduce phase total rounds is 4 1 5 in the both the cases the number of merge rounds is determined by configuration mapreduce task io sort factor which is set to 10
first case 50 files are merged into final 5 and then they are directly fed into reduce phase total rounds is 5 1 6 second case 34 files are merged into final 4 and the remaining 6 are directly read from in memory and fed into the reduce phase total rounds is 4 1 5 in the both the cases the number of merge rounds is determined by configuration mapreduce task io sort factor which is set to 10 so number of merge rounds does not change whether optimization is done or not
but the number of files which are merged in each round could change because hadoop framework could introduce some optimizations to reduce the number of merges and hence the number spills to disk
it will create multiple directories based on the source directories
in my case it was an exception because hadoop didn t find precompiled hadoop dll
i suggest creating an issue in the kotlin youtrack
you may also want to try yarn jar when launching your job versus hadoop jar since that s the new preferred way to launch yarn jobs
your current solution is a step in the right direction but it is still quite inefficient for at least three reasons mapvalues list creates a huge number of temporary list objects length for linear seq like list is o n x y once again creates a large number of temporary objects the simplest you can include is to replace list with mutable buffer with constant time length
the reason is hive does not provide the separate column to element of complex data type and indexing is only possible on column of a table
it doesn t not effect performance
so that is why i find it easier to cast directly in hive here to double
one dirty trick you can use is to cross join table1 and table2 since you don t care about their relationship anyway and use an exists condition edit while the above query should work its performance probably won t be great
your array fields would have 5 elements and index start from 0 and since the length of fields is 5 fields 5 is giving arrayindexoutofboundsexception
is the exception message for that which is leading to the spark context being shutdown
in general job job jobid cancelled because sparkcontext was shut down just means that it s an exception due to which the dag couldn t continue and needs to error out
its the spark scheduler throwing this error when it faces an exception it might be an exception that is unhandled in your code or a job failure due to any other reason
probably better put the file in hdfs then you can use using hdfs path to file py instead of a local path 3 take a look at your job on the hadoop dashboard http master node 9100 if you click on a failed task it will give you the actual java error and stack trace so you can see what actually went wrong with the execution 4 make sure python is installed on all the slave nodes
if these files have been deleted by someone or something or the env variable hadoop pid dir has been changed since you started the deamons or the user stopping the deamons is not the user that started them then hadoop will show the error messages you are seeing
your reduce function arguments should be as follows with the way you ve defined the arguments reduce operation is not getting a list of values and therefore it just outputs whatever input it gets from the map function because is just going from 0 to 1 every time because each key value pair in the form word one is coming separately to the reducer
in my case it was due to incorrect column family name
i can t see any valid reason for the restrictions anyway
assume that you want to create 3 different sets of output files the first step is to register named output files in the driver also create the different output directories or the directory structure you want in the driver code along with the actual output directory the final important step is to rename the output files based on their names
if the job is successful note this will not add any significant overhead to the job because we are only moving files from one directory to another
and choosing any particular approach depends on the nature of your implementation
based on your input path file names you can pass the input files to the corresponding mapper implementation
yes you can specify that a input format only processes certain files if you do amend the code remember the success file should be written to both folders upon successful job completion while this isn t a requirement it is a machanism by which someone can determine if the output in that folder is complete and not truncated because of an error
if you override a method you can return the file name depending on what key value pair you get and so on
this isn t possible because hive overrides the outputcommitter with it s own nulloutputcommitter
however how much higher will depend upon how much of the data is in the memstore and how much is in the block cache
the checkandmutate works like this get the row lock wait for all outstanding transactions to be ack d get the cell needed compare them using the rules supplied perform a put delete since the last step if successful is performing a put checkandmutate will have some added cost
at first it did start on 2013 03 07t16 35z so all previously collected data has been passed through underlying workflow an mr job invocation with parsing functionality while working with past time datasets dataset time less than current time workflow was running one by one it did consume pastdate hour 00 then it immediately started to consume pastdate hour 01 e t c
your java code works because it pulls your user information from the unix environment
if you see the user dr who anywhere it s probably because you haven t set a user name in your request
dmitry s suggestion in the comments to just use the oozie java action works for a cascading job or any hadoop dependent job because oozie puts all the hadoop jars in the classpath when it launches the job
they differ in that run will execute the pig script and leave its aliases and properties available for subsequent usage while exec simply executes the script and returns with the calling environment unaltered but with any new files created on hdfs available
the reason for this is that in a map the keys and values will be boxed as objects with considerable overhead while an array int or array double is just a single compact chunk of memory for convenience it might be advisable to define a builder that uses a sortedmap int double and converts into two arrays when finished building note that the code examples above are not tested but i guess you will get the idea
you get the error message because required libraries are not present on your application class path
i asked the same question and i just used spark api to get this done read the data as or and then you can do something like and then to see the results you can check this out running something like
there is also this converter of avro files to csv online it was already useful to me https avro tools com avro viewer and converter to json and csv and another way that i know is through spark https spark apache org docs latest sql data sources avro html but it is a solution that requires programming in that framework
you need to use the d0 ml method as opposed to the lf method because the optimizing routine with lf requires all data used to be loaded into the stata
primarily because avro expects the schema definition to be present in every avro file
we had a set of heterogenous items flowing in that we wanted to buffer batch and write to blob
here is a good description of the problem and its cause https community hortonworks com answers 37414 view html for us running the command hdfs debug recoverlease path path of the file retries 3 solved the problem
there are some files that opened by flume but never closed i am not sure about the reason
this is the spark driver running on yarn running out of memory due to the number of files apparently it keeps all file info in memory
i solved the problem myself with a workaround for date type you could use hive coalesce function as below the above answer can be explain as find nt assess dt which is a date type column if it is null get the next value in the coalesce function which is a non null value in above example and hence will be returned back
hence a blank can not be returned by coalesce in the above example
due to this i have used a very large date value 9999 01 01 to represent a null value and distinguish between a genuine date value
like nvl create date 1990 01 01 create date is date tyep 1990 01 01 is string type so the npe throw
here s the root cause of the exception org apache giraph utils unsafereads ensureremaining
this are crucial because are the methods that let us send and receive information in giraph
the error shows up if you use the impala or other query editor because you re using a library written for hive
although since you said that hive query editor works fine it sounds like permissions are not the issue
in my case it can be done as su hdfs since hdfs is also a name for that user
at this moment no clusterid incompatibilities should be possible so you may proceed using your hdfs
unfortunately it s not related to pig paths tried it on my configured hadoop cluster with same result
so in order to make your attempt work you have two possibilities run native mr job using hadoop and after it finishes process it s results in pig edit pig source code and compile your own version
hadoop doesn t care about a package json file so that s the first sign something is off with your system
as a result optimizing for pig s local mode seems like the wrong solution to the presented problem
this would have the desired result at the expense of two step startup and teardown
not to say there couldn t be a fine non distributed version in the project but since the emphasis is mostly big scale and hadoop that s probably why
i think it s simply because nxn matrix inversion s complexity is o n 3 and subject to numerical instability which is quite common whith sparse high dimensionnal matrices
also add the following 2 properties in your hdfs site xml file their default location is tmp because of this you lose data on each restart
all you need to do is download and configure sqoop create your mysql table schema specify hadoop hdfs file name result table name and column seperator
if you had written mapper and reducer in java you could have made use of dboutputformat so you can write a custom outputformat which meets your data output format key value of reducer to sink the data to mysql
depending on versions of hadoop and hive you re using there can be different ways to overcome this from changing a property in config to custom inputformat implementation
this stream depends on how you get your data ideally the data should be available as inputstream problem solved
thanks to nikos for pointing me in the right direction
example for mrv1 fs default name hdfs namenode address 8020 mapred job tracker jobtracker address 8021 you can also specify remote cluster address at the command line pig fs namenode address 8020 jt jobtracker address 8021 hence you can install pig to any machine and connect to remote cluster
pig includes hadoop client therefore you don t have to install hadoop to use pig
error messages error starting mrappmaster invocationtargetexception unsatisfiedlinkerror root cause fail to execute the native function anchornative in the class org apache hadoop security jnibasedunixgroupsmapping description the function anchornative will call a function in the library libhadoop so
the root cause of this problem is that emr ddb hadoop jar is not available in the environment or the location specified
the reason for this exception was i am importing 2 6 0 cdh5 13 0 via my maven pom but i downloaded the pre built files in version 2 6 0
hence the versions are indeed in conflict
i haven t tested this code so there may be some silly errors but the idea should get you 90 of the way
in the word count example it is fine to start with these values combine them into and the reduce them into the final result so the combiner is essentially a performance optimization
it s an identity reducer so you can only use the same class as both the combiner and reducer if the dataset remains valid that way
if you write your own outputformat you can fix the behaviour of the recordwriter write key value method to handle value concatenation based upon whether the key value is null or not
if single output key value can be bigger then memory it means that standard output mechanism is not suited since by inerface design it require passing of key value pair and not a stream
if you have reasons to pass data via output format i would suggest the following solution a to write to the local temporary dir b to pass the name of the file as a value for the output format
based on the pygmalion project s documentation and the source of the pig cassandra script you can establish the connection between cassandra and pig by doing the followings also make sure to include the cassandra jars to the hadoop classpath as well e g set it in hadoop env sh
i have faced same problem in my system root cause its due to when creating table its point to hdfs namenode port 9000 connection refused problem i just formatted the namenode also check connectivity to port 9000 but its not good in production real time after that start all sh start habse shell problem will resolve
for instance if you have a json file that contains objects and values so you need a way to store that content in hive
i haven t tried either of these so they are mostly suggestions
you can get this to work depending on how you are setting up your network and what you are trying to ping
i believe you need hbase client so you should also include this dependency and possibly more depending on what you re trying to compile
my peoblem is here is my solution and the progress to figure it out when run the below command to start hiveserver2 the log tells the excetion but continue to look up we find that so the reason is thad the default setting disable the hs2 interactive ha configuration
in yarn cluster mode spark submit automatically uploads the assembly jar to a distributed cache that all executor containers read from so there is no need to manually copy the assembly jar to all nodes or pass it through jars
you dont need to do anything since you dont want to buffer puts at client side
so you might have an issue during the map operation in which there is a null value in some of the field which is most probably causing your npe issue
two things to note when properties are defined multiple times with multiple conflicting values there has to be a precedence rule but i m not too sure properties defined explicitly inside oozie may have their value defined dynamically using parameters and el functions but properties defined inside job xml files must be literals because oozie does not have access to them it just passes the file content to the hadoop configuration constructor at run time what does it mean for you
i did this based on help found on this site and the hadoop tutorial
in my case urlcat java was in com tom app so the hadoop command was hadoop com tom app urlcat hdfs localhost user tom quangle txt
i realized this because the dump of a map containing strings does not typically have the quotes there
therefore you need to be keying including those quotes you have to escape them with your other option would be to change the way your data is being loaded so it doesn t include the single quotes in the strings themselves and strips them out
i haven t used scala yet so i m not entirely sure how to fix it there
sqoop will eventually execute hadoop shell script so i would make sure that your hadoop is configured properly to use the jdk instead of jre
u was getting this error in hdp to run a example jar file for wordcount caused by from the hdfs user chmod 777 on the user directory and i could use my ubuntu user a sudoer to run a jar file
as sasikkumar answer but with rbenv it will show optional if 1 8 7 p370 doesn t appear then you should specifiy the rbenv version by using the following command local because it will be used on path needed but you can use global for general use then you can try to list the jobflows
in front of the regex for example i needed i m guessing because the source pattern also includes the bucket name
if so hadoop is configured to use the log4j properties file located on hdfs so you would need to update that log file
this is because it is the driving application that should have control of what logging it wants done regardless of what logging the libraries that it uses want
as you said the application which you are creating has log4j that doesnt matter when you are making it into jar because jar wont have your log4j while devloping once you convert it to jar
it s an old question but since this could help someone else i am answering it
cause of this problem is that the class is not found in your class path
old command list and new version of hadoop does not support this functionality because of yarn
the long answer will depend on the directory structure of your data
for example if your split column contains few rows with value 1 and 10m rows with values 10000 10000000 and num mappers 8 then sqoop will split the dataset between mappers not evenly 1st mapper will get few rows with 1 2nd 7th mappers will get 0 rows 8th mapper will get almost 10m rows that will result in data skewing and 8th mapper will run for ever or even fail
when doing input process output type of spark jobs there are three separate issues to consider input parallelism processing parallelism output parallelism in your case the input parallelism is 1 because in your question you claim that you cannot change the input format or granularity
however you can control the output parallelism which will give you two benefits multiple cpus will write thus decreasing the total time of the write operation
data size parition skew cluster ram size number of cores in the cluster the type of follow on processing you ll do the size of cluster ram cores you ll use for follow on processing the system you are writing to without knowing your goals and constraints it is difficult to make a solid recommendation but here are a couple general guidelines to work with since your partitions won t be skewed the above use of repartition will use a hash partitioner that corrects for skew you will get the fastest throughput if you set the number of partitions equal to the number of executor cores assuming that you are using nodes with sufficient i o
what fit means here depends on your processing
the latter varies based on how you process the data and how much benefit spark can get from predicate pushdown parquet supports that
btw unless your data has a very specific structure do not hard code partition numbers because then your code will run sub optimally on clusters of varying sizes
you can then multiply by the number of cores per executor based on the machines you are using
in case you are not sure what a partition is i explained it to myself in memoryoverhead issue in spark
it occurred because i didn t add hadoop home in environment var
in my case i was running spark earlier and it was referring hadoop jar s and this was causing access issues
sorted map output is then partitioned by key so that one partition is created per reducer
in your mapper write a sorter and grouper which will ignore the pk fk tagging so that your records are sent to the same reducer regardless of whether they are a pk record or a fk record and are grouped together
the result of this step will be that all records with the same key will be sent to the same reducer and be in the same set of values to be reduced
now the reducer the result of this will be file b with all occurrences of k replaced by the value of k in file a
you can also extend this to effect a full inner join or to write out both files in their entirety for direct database storage but those are pretty trivial modifications once you get this working
the error is because of jdk mismatch on the machine which you are compiling and the machine on which you are running the jar
so it means your hadoop lzo jar is not in your hadoop classpath you can then copy your jar to your hadoop lib folder or add the path to you hadoop bin hadoop env sh you have to do it on all your nodes i hope it will solve it
both are correct but some people have preference for one over the other for various reasons
this results in duplicate code as you will have the exact same expression in both your select and group by clause
both should have the same result
which you should use in this case will depend on your particular use or perhaps personal preference
since the udf row sequence is used in the reducer and the reducer count should be kept 1 inorder to keep the autoincrement field distinct
finally your use of distinct in this case is to perform count distinct which corresponds to a cardinality aggregation which can be approximate or exact depending on your needs
there is a delete by query api which you can use but be careful about high percentages of deleted documents lucene and elasticsearch are not optimized for this and you will incur an overhead due to delete markers in the data
so if you drop the number of b rows you see you will get more benefit than the a in your example if you can filter the ip logs table table 2 since i am making a guess that it has more rows than your order number table it will cut down on the execution time
using homebrew on osx install the required dependencies symlink protoc verify the version libprotoc 2 5 0 export build flags check hadoop version fetch the hadoop source for the version returned above and build copy the native libs to your homebrew installation update hadoop env sh amend hadoop opts may be commented out restart hadoop and run the following to verify based on instructions from https medium com faizanahemad hadoop native libraries installation on mac osx d8338a6923db
it appears the format of credentials flags has changed since the previous version
in case if some one came for with same error using d hadoop security credential provider path please ensure your credentials store jceks file is located in distributed file system hdfs as distcp starts form one of the node manager node so it can access the same
the exception gets thrown because there are two branches which have both inherited the same name from earlier in the pipe assembly
the mahout installation manual from cloudera has the following section during the cdh3 installation cloudera s package repository http archive cloudera com debian release cdh3 contrib is being configured in your system so that after following the manual you shall be able to install mahout using apt get
wherever they have oltp and full transactional need they still depend on rdbms
hbase has no plan about supporting sp since it only focuses on being a storage and more like nosql
create table sqoop root version int propname varchar 128 not null propval varchar 256 constraint sqoop root unq unique version propname inserted the following row this seems to be the reason your script is failing insert into sqoop root values null sqoop hsqldb job storage version 0 i think the correct way might be is to download the source and extend org apache sqoop metastore jobstorage with you db implementation
however we are seeing cases when we are running many sqoop jobs updating the metastore concurrently sqoop 1 4 6 has no code to trap and handle cases where metastore updates for incremental updates fail due to concurrency issues
this will cause the next incremental run will import duplicate data
this may be an issue with hypersql as well but it would be much less likely because hsql is in memory so faster
reason org apache hadoop conf configuration adddeprecation method is added from hadoop 2 3 0
it may be not be optimal way but since i am solving it for test code it should be fine
so the final code is also we need to add dependency in the pom xml this dependency is used for making use of the scala tuple2 the error of stream 0 received 0 block was due to the spark worker not available and and the spark worker core was set to 1
for spark streaming we need the core to be 2 so we need to make changes in the spark config file
the number of output files depends on number of partitions in the rdd
instead you can specify such application specific properties via conf option in spark shell or spark submit depending on how you run the job
i studied my case and found out that based on my design assigning 32gb of ram would be sufficient
in my case i got this error because a firewall was blocking the block manager ports between the driver and the executors
since you are using 2 2 0 there is no jobtracker
port 8020 is for the hdfs namenode service so my guess is that service not started or has failed
this is probably what s causing mismatches you re mixing incompatible versions
its problem is that it ships with a copy of org apache hadoop conf configuration that is much older than all current versions of hadoop so it may end up being the one picked up in the classpath
i am sure that the avro tools coders had some good reason to include a copy of a file that belongs to another package hadoop common i was really surprised to find it there and made me waste an entire day
i just went into my spark home and moved the hadoop common jar so it wouldn t be loaded after that it ran in local mode anyway
i m assuming that hadoop uses the genericoptionsparser because i can find no reference to it anywhere in my project
i am getting fairly familiar with hadoop mapreduce but i didnt write the pieces that use the maxmind geoip component in the project so i ve had to do a little digging to understand it well enough to do the explanation i have here
one common mistake seen it on other forums is due to permissions issues on the folder where hadoop is trying to run the jar file
the os has an internal loopback address for the range 127 0 0 0 8 so you could name any address in here
check your slaves file in conf slaves remove everything and add localhost in that file remove the name and data directory mentioned in dfs name dir and dfs data dir property under hdfs site xml
this usually results when you format the namenode and don t do a datanode clean up and you namespace changes
i had to format my namenode with after starting namenode datanode was failing to start because of version problem then i need to remove all the data from datanodes also
since import org apache hadoop hbase mapred tableoutputformat is deprecated you can use following code as a draft
i guess it causes by the localhost
it s because of the same hostname in both datanodes
as rahul said the problem is because of the same hostname change your hostname in etc hostname file and give different hostname for each host and resolve hostname with ip address etc hosts file then restart your cluster you will see all datanodes in datanode information tab on browser
i have the same trouble because i use ip instead of hostname hdfs dfsadmin report is correct though it is only one localhost in ui
but still i d like to share my answer the root cause is from hadoop etc hadoop hdfs site xml the xml file has a property named dfs datanode data dir
setup extract the food choices and for each make a tuple of name food 1 total up each name food combination remap so that the name only is the key pick the food with the largest count at each step and we re done edit to collect all the food items that have the same top count for a person we just change the last two lines start with a list of items with total in the equal case concatenate the list of food items with that score if you want the top 3 say then use aggregatebykey to assemble a list of the favorite foods per person instead of the second reducebykey
the reasoning for this is because yarn places a limit on the amount of off heap memory your process is allowed to use
i do not think you will be able to host 2 instances of hadoop on the same system because of certain environment variables
when an lmdb database starts it reserves 1 tb of virtual memory this caused hadoop to think that i was using this much memory while in fact i wasn t
note that you shouldn t use that unless you re sure of it because hadoop is trying to protect you from memory leaks and similar issues by this check
i only used it because i was sure it wasn t a memory leak
i customized this script myself so that the initial hadoop get is a curl call to a webserver hosting the input files i need i didn t want to put all the files in hdfs
you can take a look at combinefileinputformat in hadoop which can implicitly combine multiple files and split it based on the files
hadoop can not handle many small files in addition to your reasons each file needs to have an entry in the master
reading through small files normally causes lots of seeks and lots of hopping from datanode to datanode to retrieve each small file all of which is an inefficient data access pattern
its tailor made for storing files
since you re using pig you don t actually need an involved regular expression you can just use the boolean operators supplied by pig combined with a couple of easy regular expressions example
you can use this regex for matches method note that foo or foo bar or foobar should be written as foobar foo bar foo not foo foo bar foobar to prevent matching only foo in string containing foobar or foo bar also since look ahead is zero width you need to pass
i m guessing that id in reality is a primary key but note that hive does not know this so the above data set is perfectly valid
with all that in mind it s not clear to me how to fix it because i don t know the desired output
so which is okay for list id list name and list genre but the list rating well that is always going to give some problem here i just learnt pig along with hive so grouping works differently there so to tackle the problem i casted the rating and averaged it out and stored it in the float table
any reasons to that
common mistake in your job configuration after you create your job object you need to pull back the configuration object as job makes a copy of it and configuring values in conf2 after you create the job will have no effect on the job iteself
in your case you re missing the hadoop common 0 xx jar so you should add this to the classpath and you should be good to go
i ll show it but hadoop is taking arg 0 as package path instead of input in hdfs path and arg 1 as input in hdfs path instead of output in hdfs path so in order to make it work you should use with arg 1 and arg 2 so it ll get the right things
the above error is because of insufficient privilege for hive localhost in mysql server

you need to change your query to something like this so that insert overwrite comes before select q subscription id clause in your query please see this sample
since reduce task will run just on 1 physical machine and reduce function will be called just once local counter inside the function solves the problem
this is based on the other answer but to clarify for upgrade cloudera 5 4 step 1 step 2 step 3 delete the data in zookeeper warning it will make you lost your old data it opens up the zookeeper shell
i had faced the similar issue in the past
the problem was due to a difference between the cluster id of data node hadoop 2 5 0 hdfs datanode current version and the cluster id in the namenode as in hadoop 2 5 0 hdfs namenode current version
i ve just had to set to the same cid but no idea what caused this difference may be formatting hdfs many times via hadoop home bin hdfs namenode format
it s not exactly a bug just a side effect of open source when it s done by a motley crew of people all around the world with no product owner and no incentives to use a common programming style or run extensive regression tests or insert your complaint here
aaaaaaah now that it s said i feel better let s get to the point
and i see no reason why it should improve any time soon
update jun 2017 looks like alter finally supports the db table syntax on recent cloudera distro tested on cdh 5 10 with hive 1 1 0 but since they usually include a number of back ports in their distro maybe it s a feature of hive 1 2
it s because the matches operator operates exactly like java s string matches i e
since your vm doesn t support usecompressedoops option
this actually depends on the vm mode you are running with there are 2 types 1 server side 2 client side usecompressedoops is recognized by the server vm and probably that s the reason why you are getting this error there could be multiple ways to check under which mode the vm is currently running but the easiest one i could find is to simply run java version and it should print some thing like this there are few nice discussion regarding these two flavors of vm
it is because namenode enters into safemode how to leave
simple answer is to escape the like this so your line would be row format delimited fields terminated by line terminated by n
which may be related to jar files because all the required class files were not included
noclassdeffounderror arises from the jvm having problems finding a class it expected to find
a program that was working at compile time can t run because of class files not being found
noclassdeffounderror occurs when the named class is successfully located in the classpath but for some reason cannot be loaded and verified
you should already added hadoop core jar in your build path so no compile error detected in your program
but you get the error when you run it because hadoop core is dependent on commons logging jar as well as some other jars
this is most likely due to free disk space
i think adding this extra arg to the pig command line call should work with s3 or s3n depending on where your file is stored you should be able to add that in the extra args box when creating the job flow
i had a similar error and found that this permission error was caused due to the hadoop program not being able to create or access the files
the tutorial is based on running webpie on amazon ec2 so there may be some difference in configuration
the input data must consist of gzipped compressed files of triples in n triples format for exemple triplepart1 gz triplepart2 gz so we have input triples tar gz that contains compressed files of n triples triplepart1 gz triplepart2 gz
i guess that if you don t see anything in your solr indexes it is because no data for those urls is stored in the nutch db since nutch will take care to sync its db with the indexes
not having data in the db may be explained by the fact that the urls are isolated hence you can try the inject command to include those sites
i would try to actually see the internal db to verify the nutch behavior since before inserting values in the indexes nutch stores data inside its dbs
assigning a higher score has no effect since lucene will give you a result as long as the data is in the index
solr now reads html files using tika by default so that s not a problem
http wiki apache org solr tikaentityprocessor if all you want is listed pages is there a specific reason to use the nutch crawler
warning last point is just my recommendation based on my own experience if your cluster is yet in experimental phase
the tricks is in being able to calculate the total size of the result file and then feeding the sequenceinputstream with an enumeration inputstream
i m not sure how applicable this in your scenario especially since in my understanding some python libraries must be compiled
a likely cause for your problem is that you are trying to bind to an illegal ip address
i think all of this is due to a lack of permissions
to my knowledge the above error could be because of sample class with same package structure ie javax ws rs ext runtimedelegate found in different jars issue
so there is every possibility the the code responsible for triggering drop syntax the above class would be used and broken due as it it is found more than once in the classpath
it is something spark automatically assigns for each partition while writing so that each partition writes to a unique file
here you get an exception because you are trying to build a charbuffer that s too big most likely an integer that became negative after going out of bound
twhat you could do is a bit hacky but since you only have one key with a big array it may work
your json file might look like or like this but i think in your case it is the former thus you could try changing the line delimiter used by hadoop to as here
but i m curious to hear more about since in my org tez has been beating mapred in most use cases
pls check again one of the reason might be proxy issue aws uses http proxy to connect to aws cluster
note afaik if you have s3 access to aws emr no need to set access keys every time since it will be implicit
the file names can be derived from the output keys and values
you may see where this causes issues for your approach each mapper may get only a piece of a file
since hadoop tries to be smart about how it does map reduce processes it may be required to specify the number of reducers to use so that each mapper goes to a single reducer
in packaged environments the start stop scripts are tuned to provide a unique location for each type of service via the same hadoop log dir env var so they do not have the same issue you re seeing
since you are processing big data the size of your tracing messages can be huge so it can cause a problem
the files would take a few more processing steps to get to our visualizations but we run natively on hadoop so the files would not be far away
i post another answer here because it s the first sow question that comes up in google when asking for hdfs s3 proxy and the existing answer is not the best according to me
you will need this file distributed to all the nodes so it can do a distributed copy
hence re create file and re write the contents to it rather than appending
this problem is caused by some bug in hadoop append code
you can set the speculative action to false or can create a file to some temporary location with the timestamp or any other variable things in path and merge the result to base path later
i do not to answer a question for such an old spark version but i know that when the application hangs it is probably due to your resources being killed by yarn for example
the best thing you could do is to fine tune your application since there is not any information in your question that would suggest how to fix this
for another job i had to fine tune in order to scale to 15t data i reported my approach in memoryoverhead issue in spark but i don t know if this is related
missing parents is the list of stages whose results are required to compute the requested results and which aren t already cached in memory
based on the supplied schema avro found the pojo in the classpath and tried to instantiate a specificrecord instead of genericrecord
because of this reason i went with option 1
declare writers and readers based on the schema
i wasn t able to find an existing solution so i implemented it myself
i had approximately same issue in the past was unable to submit hive job to the cluster with badgateway response
i m not sure how hadoop chooses the number of reducers necessary but it does seem to go small in some situations and that can cause significant performance lags
in my case this error was caused by not having a user scott directory on hdfs with write permissions for the hiveserver running as cloudera scm user my jdbc connection uses scott as the user id
amazon changed the default behavior starting emr 4 7 0 which caused this error when we upgraded emr versions
actually the shapes expected by mxnet were dependent on the data set it actually depended on the maximum value in the data set
the prediction however works well with single node setup because it has all the data used in training
this was causing the error
that may be the reason you are getting this error as partition is a folder only
flume was used initially but replaced by this approach due to performance issue
this means that you have to transform your data into mahout vectors because that is the kind of data that clusterization algoritms work with
vectorization process will depend on the nature of your data i e
your data seems to be easily vectorizable since it only have an id and 4 numerical values
then you apply the mahout clustering algorithms to this input and you will keep the id vector name of each vector in the clustering results
the reason for that is that each mapper runs in its own jvm they will be distributed on different machines so there s no way you can share a variable or object across multiple mappers or reducers easily
if you see any 127 0 ip then comment out because hadoop will see them first as host s
let us know the result once this steps are followed
the base idea of mapreduce is that the order in which things are done is irrelevant so you cannot and do not need to control the order in which the input records go through the mappers
a simple google action for this term resulted in several points where you can continue
the location of this directory is usually configured in hive site xml with the property name as oozie service workflowappservice system libpath so oozie should find the jar easily
but in my case hive site xml did not include this property so oozie didn t know where to look for this jar hence the java lang noclassdeffounderror
depends on where sharedlib directory is configured on your cluster
i think that the problem is caused by the context class loader that loads hadoop classes in your web application
the problem i had was caused by having the wrong file dir permissions and ownership after i moved the data blocks
here you could write a simple exectuion task in hadoop improved inputs the solvers can perform much better if you hand in the data accordingly sparse matrix in your code you use lpsolve lp
final thought have you tried to raise your question in quant stackexchange com because numerical optimization is closely related to mathematics and does not involve that much programming
based on the first line of the second message 14 05 05 21 19 27 warn util nativecodeloader unable to load native hadoop library for your platform using builtin java classes where applicable i suppose that you re running hadoop in a 64 bit operating system
the reason why you are getting this error is that the library file usr lib hadoop lib native libhadoop so 1 0 0 is not meant for a 64 bit underlying architecture
i was running it as my user and did not have permissions to write in that directory
earlier we were running in the standalone mode and that lead to duplicating the configuration on all the slaves
i suspect the problem comes exactly from the negative progress note that since you are using the amrmasyncclient requests are not made immediately when you call addcontainerrequest
the first acquire is supposedly done right after the register so the getprogress function should be called then and update the existing progress
as it is your progress will be updated to nan because at this time allocatedyarncontainers will be empty and completedyarncontainers will also be 0 and so your returned progress will be the result of 0 0 which is not defined
it just so happens that when the next allocate checks your progress value it will fail because nans return false in all comparisons and so no other allocate function will actually communicate with the resourcemanager because it quits right at that first step with an exception
thanks to alexandre fonseca for pointing out that getprogress returns a nan for division by zero when it s called before the first allocation which makes the resourcemanager to quit immediately with an exception
i tried creating a bucketed and non bucketed table table through hive which is a table 6gb in size i tried benchmarking the results from both
so the answer is impala doesn t know whether a table is bucketed or not so it doesn t take advantage of it impala 1990
i had the same problem and the cause was that one of my decoders had the incorrect constructor
the major reason for an oozie job getting stuck in prep state eventually moving to start manual state is misconfiguration of hadoop services ports
in my case the problem was due to yarn being stopped
hbase site xml and other site xml were not properly injected in java code so i had to make below changes
it also could be because of non sun jvm
this may help you to get your result
the devil is in the details so you can get better answers if the details are explicit
if you want the workers to do jobs and have the results of the jobs reconfigured back in one master node you ll be much better off using a dedicated r solution and not a system like taktuk or dsh which are more general parallelization tools
your mapper is reading no 0s because your input files contain no 0s
everything below here is mostly wrong because i misunderstood the algorithm the part above is still useful though from the linked page you re using strategy 3
the partitioner is just straight up wrong here and you re getting matrices full of 0s because it s multiplying by data that was previously initialized to 0 and never overwritten with the correct data for the block
this is hidden on 1 machine operation because the partitioner is a null operation but breaks in most clusters
since assignment to a reducer is round robin this guarantees that the a matrix keys will not be assigned to the same reducer as the b matrix keys
therefore the algorithm fails since it assumes something about assignment and ordering of keys that is provably incorrect
this is not a very good partitioner but it is the only partitioner that will work because non identical keys are required to be sorted to the same reducer in a particular order
thanks to harsh on the hadoop mailing list for helping me with this
workaround 1 start from scratch i can testify that the following steps solve this error but the side effects won t make you happy me neither
workaround 2 updating namespaceid of problematic datanodes big thanks to jared stehler for the following suggestion
i got the reason
it because the multioutput each multioutput by default has a counter
there are more multioutput after my change so it get exceed error
if the error version mismatch expected 28 received 26738 is seen intermittently with a very high received version the cause can be that an application that does not use the hadoop rpc protocoll has connected to the datenode port
a misconfiguration can have similar effects
spark 1 2 0 depends on hadoop 2 2 0 be default
if for some reason you can t upload to any repository use maven s install install file or one of the answers here maven add a dependency to a jar by relative path
because you ve specified hbase zookeeper property datadir option but there is no hbase zookeeper quorum there and other significant options
the error originates from here https github com apache hive blob 3b6825b5b61e943e8e41743f5cbf6d640e0ebdf5 shims 0 20s src main java org apache hadoop hive shims hadoop20sshims java l579
but in general you will want to use elasticsearch hadoop so you ll need to add that dependency to your build sbt file e g
of course if you re doing this with spark it implies you ve got more rows than you ll want to type out by hand so for your case you d need to transform your data into an rdd of maps from key value within your script
note 1 options can also be set in conf spark defaults conf file so you don t need to provide them every time with conf read the guide
i did a couple of experiments on ways we can start a namenode and observed the ports using netstat nltpa 1 hadoop config conf namenode regular 2 directly invoking the namenode main class 3 add the default core default xml and than start up the namenode my observation was for 2 and 3 only standard ports showed up so i looked up the java options and that was the bingo
comment all of below in hadoop env sh and then start hadoop you will see only standard port so the additional ports you see are all jmx bin ports hope this helps
if the hadoop ports in question have a dynamic range that changes then there would be no reason to perform this update
we have had this nasty issue with hortonworks distro 2 3 2 shame on them the oozie launcher job always gets httpcore and httpclient in the classpath as part of the hadoop client the oozie launcher job always gets httpcore and httpclient as bundled in the oozie sharelib the hive hive2 sharelibs contain httpcore and httpclient in a more recent version from hadoop point of view user classpath first applies to both sharelibs so it s a 50 50 chance of getting the right order for each jar so a 25 75 chance overall bottom line we had to remove httpcore and httpclient from the oozie sharelib hdfs dir duh
post scriptum the oozie server keeps in memory a list of the jars in each sharelib so that removing a jar while the server is running will trigger errors in new jobs
you want to build with your local version of the httpcore jar but you don t want it present in your classpath because hadoop will provide its own version
if i understand your question in spark would be resolve like this 1 read with spark csv and add prop delimiter to t 2 over rdd map to apply function over every register 3 use flatmap for multiply results 4 save with sqlcontext 5 read other tables with sqlcontext and apply join
default constructor of stopwatch class became private since guava v 17 and marked deprecated even earlier
after going through the code that is resulting in the error i see these might be the issues
was thrown and caused the weird spill exception
try this to eliminate the possibility that your inputs are causing the r script to not produce an answer
you could also do this from the command line tools but it s a little easier from the gui since hopefully you only need to do this once
thus you get one run for each mapper then it ends
if you run the above one liner you will only get out one result not a result for each line in infile txt
since the 0 6 0 version did not have the specified constructor for rests3service the java lang verifyerror was getting thrown
i get the exact error message if i try to do hadoop fs anything when the datanode namenode aren t running so i would guess the same is happening for you
passwordless is useful so that every time you try to run a job you don t have to enter your password again for each of the slave nodes
i came across the same problem as yours when i install cdh5 1 0 with kerberos security using tarball solutions found by google are insufficient memory but i don t think it s my situation since my input is very small 52k
after digging several days i found root cause in this link
to sum up solutions in that link can be add following property in yarn site xml even it s default in yarn default xml property name yarn nodemanager aux services mapreduce shuffle class name value org apache hadoop mapred shufflehandler value property remove property yarn nodemanager local dirs and use default value tmp then exec following commands mkdir p tmp hadoop yarn nm local dir chown yarn yarn tmp hadoop yarn nm local dir the problem can be concluded after setting yarn nodemanager local dirs property the property yarn nodemanager aux services mapreduce shuffle class in yarn default xml doesn t work
the root cause i haven t found also
removing the fsimage file from the running namenode will not cause issue with the read write operations
this is also one of the reason secondary node keeps on sync after 1 hour 1 milliion transactions from edit logs so that on start up from last checkpoint not much needs to be synced
the entire file system namespace including the mapping of blocks to files and file system properties is stored in a file called the fsimage remember mapping of blocks to files is a part of fsimage this is stored both in memory and on disk along with fsimage hadoop will also store in memory block to datanode mapping through block reports while the name node is re started and periodically so when you move a file to a different location this will be tracked in the edit log on disk and also when a block report is sent by data node to namenode namenode will get an up to date view of where blocks are located on the cluster so that way you will not be able to see the data in old path since block report has updated mapping of blocks to datanodes but remember the update has happened only in the memory now after a certain amount of time either in checkpointing or when a name node is restarted editlogs on disk which already have the updates that you have done in your case movement of file will get merged with the old fsimage on disk and creates a new fsimage now this updated fsimage will be loaded into memory and the same process repeats
it is exactly mentioned in chapter 11 in hadoop the definitive guide book having said that the answer is simple because after updating the edit log namenode updates the in memory representation
i think its a semantic error because it misses the most imp parameter of external table definition viz
the data is not found because of that which gives the error
i decided to cat the file because i was able to run the program over another file in the same folder of hdfs and receive the following
for example here is the com google protobuf directory in the recent 3 1 0 version https github com google protobuf tree v3 1 0 java core src main java com google protobuf based on this it is likely that your application has picked up a version of protobuf other than 2 5 0 and put it on the classpath
if more resources in your computing department are a no go you re going to have to consider breaking down your data set into manageable chunks before you do any work on it ad reduce the results down into a meaningful set
note that dfs data dir may contain a space or comma separated list of directory names so that data may be stored on multiple devices
because hadoop re uses the objects passed to the reduce method just calling the readfields method of the same object the underlying contents of the key parameter k will change with each iteration of the values iterable
no need for rsync since you re putting the logs in dated directories
obviously it has drawbacks ordinals can change so if you exchange enum 2 with enum 3 and read a previously serialized file this will return the other wrong enum
i don t know anything about hadoop but based on the documentation of the interface you could probably do it like that
this issue happened to me because of the way i a beginner extracted the hive tar file
the jar was expected to be in usr local hive lib but for some reasons it was in usr local hive bin lib
the question is about that the hive path so you can check up all configuration file involving the hive path
1 the environment parameter etc profile or profile 2 hive home conf hive env sh hive is based on hadoop so you must configure the hadoop s path on the hive env sh
this is happening because you are using localhost in your configuration settings
well it depends on several things like the kind of processing you are going to perform desired response time etc
cannot post link due to less than 10 reputation and there was an error thrown while launching pig job regarding hadoop compat
i recommend you use gsutil to explore the read only bucket you re interested in since it doesn t need the placeholder objects and once you have a glob expression that returns the list of objects you want processed use that glob expression in your hadoop command
run sudo lsof i to be certain no other services are using them for some reason
update follow this tutorial here if the problem persists it might be due to permission issue
i have an embedded hbase i had this error after deleting manually hbase data so i have had to clean zookeeper and the rest of hbase with that solved the problem for me
but due to some problem in hbase it wasn t able to create it
therefore i would recommend checking your pheonix configuration for connectivity issues like wrong mapping of ip address forgetting to create a password less ssh etc
i had imported text in driver class as instead of because of which i was getting the error once i rectified the mistake it started working fine
the error is due to the fact that the sparkcontext is not stopped this is required in versions higher than spark 2 x
then the following worked change parameters accordingly or
i figured out that i am not submitting the spark job to the cluster but a single machine and hence the disk space issues
i was always submitting my script in the following way since i want my script to be executed on the hadoop cluster and use yarn as resource manager i changed my submit command to the following then it worked fine
here s how i understand them when i was saving directly to s3 it was related to the issue that steve loughran mentioned where the renames on s3 were just incredibly slow so it looked like my cluster was doing nothing
the moving of data couldn t happen because of spark and spark wouldn t shut down because my program was still trying to copy data to s3 so they were locked
starting streams is in general fast so it is fair to assume that delay is caused by initialization of static objects and dependencies
in that case you ll need only sparkcontext sparksession and no streaming dependencies so process can be described as start new spark application
at the very high level the happy path could be visualized as since it is very generic pattern it could be implemented in a different ways depending on a language and infrastructure lightweight messaging queue like ø mq
it could be that your mapreduce job is running over only one input split and thus does not require more mappers
thus to new configuration properties would now look like this tested and verified on hadoop 2 4 x ooize 4 0 0
hence even though a correct version of guava is present in your with dependencies jar an older version of guava jar was being loaded from hadoop classpath and distributed to your mappers reducers
this issue may happen due to one or all of the following issues configuration issue in hbase site xml open hbase site xml in an editor of your choice and make sure the following properties are set properly assuming you setup hdfs and created hbase directory in there configuration property name hbase rootdir name value hdfs localhost 9000 hbase value property property name hbase zookeeper property clientport name value 2182 value property property name hbase zookeeper property datadir name value usr local var zookeeper value property property name hbase master name value localhost 60000 value description the host and port that the hbase master runs at description property configuration if you are using a local directory as hbase rootdir please replace hdfs localhost 9000 hbase to file hbase rootdir
configuration issue in hbase env sh open hbase env sh in text editor of your choice and remove the tag from export hbase manages zk true zookeeper server not started start zookeeper by going to the zookeeper directory and execute the following at the terminal bin zkserver start finally restart hbase once you are done with updating these configurations
trying to achieve the same result i found out the following files is associated only to local files on machine running the spark submit command and converts to conf addfile
in my case i want to run it from oozie so i dont know on which machine its going to run and i dont want to add a copy file action to my workflow
the quote yuval itzchakov took refers to jars which only handles jars since it converts to conf addjar so as far as i know there is no strait way to load configuration file from hdfs
my approach was to pass the path to my app and read the configuration file and merge it into reference file p s the error only means that the configfactory didnt find any configuration file so he couldn t find the property you are looking for
using filter at input format level filter pushdown is off depending on spark s version you are using the predicate pushdown option spark sql parquet filterpushdown might be turned off
i was running into a problem where hive couldn t partition my dataset because hive exec max dynamic partitions was set to 100 so i googled this issue and somewhere on hortonworks forums i saw an answer saying that i should just do this this was another problem maybe hive tries to open as many of those concurrent connections as you set hive exec max dynamic partitions so my insert query didn t start working until i decreased these values to 500
there is an existing issue in their bugtracker to make it easy to read and write parquet files in java without depending on hadoop but there does not seem to be much progress on it
edit part 1 okay for some reason i am going to explain myself so to start with i stumbled upon this question because of the sql tag and saw hive and started to not look and just skip it
i looked i saw a sql logic correction in the original query posted that i knew would be needed and would help so i posted only because no one had answered
and you seem to be getting answers now so
end edit part 2 update for comment question additional criteria part 1 i am working with tsql so i can t test for you an exact query with your syntax but the concepts of the joins are the same and this will return what you want
you will have to write the reducer yourself based on your matching criteria
now that brings us to the real question what kind of queries do you need to run
to do aggregations in hbase you need to run a mapreduce job though that job can then go and store it s results back into hbase for low latency access again
i have coded a wordcount job based on a chain mapper
the code has been written on new api and its working well the part of the output has been shown below you might get to see some special or unwanted characters since i have not used any cleansing in order to remove the punctuation
based on the stacktrace your output directory is not empty
so that is the argument on the zero th index
based on the stacktrace and the code you have provided
also a small tip for you you can separate the files with comma so you can set them with a single call like this and in your java code
if the jar option is specified the first non option argument is the name of a jar archive containing class and resource f iles for the application with the startup class indicated by the main class manifest header so what i would suggest that you add a manifest files to your jar where in you specify the main class
if it s true then you should look into the log files in the logs directory for a more specific reason
it is responsible for managing resources available on a single node
applicationmaster an instance of a framework specific library an applicationmaster runs a specific yarn job and is responsible for negotiating resources from the resourcemanager and also working with the nodemanager to execute and monitor containers
its been a long time since i have used hadoop site xml
this is because the namenode stores all the metadata of the hdfs block allocations block locations etc
it s actually recommended to configure namenode to use multiple directories one local and other nfs mount so that multiple copies of file system metadata will be stored
does this sound reasonable or overkill since everything else i ve read suggests that you don t really need expensive high speed storage for hadoop
not using partitions may lead to long running full table scans and hence stuck at map 0 reduce 0
even if this node actually had a local copy of the data required by x it will not be assigned that task because the other node was able to acquire the lock to the master slightly faster than the latter node
this results in poor data locality but fast task assignment
the running time of your jobs may be dominated by the stragglers tasks that take longer to complete and shuffle phase so improving data locality would only have a very modest improve in running time if any at all
in the results they show that increasing the replication factor to three improves data locality significantly with diminishing returns after that
since you typically have 3 replicas for redundancy sake already there isn t much motivation to help scheduler performance for people with a replication of 1
those values look like timestamps in milliseconds since the epoch
the error might be due to permission issue on local filesystem
i meet the same problems and search it two days finally i find the reason is that datenode start a moment and shut down
solve steps hadoop fs chmod r 777 home abc employeedetails hadoop fs chmod r 777 user hive warehouse employee employeedetails copy 1 vi hdfs site xml and add follow infos dfs permissions enabled false hdfs daemon start datanode vi hdfs site xml find the location of dfs datanode data dir and dfs namenode name dir if it is the same location you must change it this is why i can t start datanode reason
follow dfs datanode data dir data current edit the version and copy clusterid to dfs namenode name dir data current clusterid of version start all sh if above it is unsolved to be careful to follow below steps because of the safe of data but i already solve the problem because follow below steps
it s part of a larger code base so not posting here for readbility unpack format and sparkschema could be defined as following for example
probably it s just because you are defining the stopwords words english every time on the executor
i changed my command as therefore i could get result
download the package from here and issue the followings tested on pig v0 10 0 when further flattening the result you ll end up having the desired result
however since your were using avro files as your input you probably want to write avro files with the same schema
peter s workaround is good and it is fixed in hue 3 8 and since cdh5 3 2
nevertheless the job could fail for other reasons that we can t know because we can t see the all the code involved
a javasparkcontext is indeed not serializable for a bunch of reasons that you could find on the web
in your code you re not serializing it directly but you do hold a reference to it because your function is not static and hence it holds a reference to the enclosing class
you could try rewritting this function either statically or write your function as a non nested class or make the javasparkcontext local so that it is not serialized
if possible i rather advice that you take the latest option for the simple reason that it is best practice to create this javasparkcontext locally because otherwise you ll have hundreds of non serializable issues due to every reference sometimes tricky to find you might hold to your class
create a separate class for your mapper and implements srielizable sometimes inner classes cause compiling issue in the spark environment
but you should use closure so that this error can be avoided
i would strongly recommend that you use tools such as this one c number of cores you have for each node m amount of memory you have for each node giga d number of disk you have for each node bool true if hbase is installed false if not this should give you something like edit your yarn site xml and mapred site xml accordingly
below query will result only the first 20 records from the table using between operator to specify range to fetch rows from 20 to 40 then increase the lower upper bound values
the limit clause is used to set a ceiling on the number of rows in the result set
you are getting a syntax error because of an incorrect usage of this hql clause
if you are attempting to paginate your results the following may be of use
first i would recommend against leaning on hql for pagination in most situations that would be more efficiently implemented on the application logic side query large result set cache what you need paginate with application logic
if you have no choice but to pull out ranges of rows you can get the desired effect through a combination of the limit order by and offset clauses
limit this will limit your result set to a maximum number of row order by this will sort order your result set based on one or more columns offset this will start your result set at a certain row after the logical first entry in the table
the queries will return no more than 1000 rows due to the limit clause
each result set will start at a different row due to the offset being incremented by the page size for each query
i am not sure what you are trying to achieve but that will return the 1001 and the 2001 record in the query results set only if you are using hive a hive version greater than 2 0 0 https issues apache org jira browse hive 11531
the problems people have sometimes when using the accepted answer are due to a bug in scala compiler link
so the first thing is that the default hbase config will not work because of the external internal ip idiosynchronicies that ec2 faces
so you cant use hconfiguration because it defaults to a localhost quorum what you ll have to do is use the configuration that amazon sets up for you located in home hadoop hbase conf hbase site xml and just manually add it to a blank configuration object
the reason is because hbase 94 x is compiled by default for hadoop1 so you have to grab the cloudera hbase jar named hbase 0 94 6 cdh4 3 0 jar you can find this online which has been compiled against hadoop2
when spark runs in multithreaded mode all the threads try and deserialise using the same encoder decoder instances which predicatbly has bad results
as a workaround i abandoned the newapihadooprdd way and implemented a parallel load mechanism based on defining intervals on the document id and then loading each partition in parallel
since i was able to successfully operate with hadoop via the windows command it didn t make much sense to waste time trying to figure out how to make it work with cygwin
https issues apache org jira browse hadoop 10133 based on this i added the following line to my zshrc or bashrc for you if you have not set hadoop home you should
this is because your broadcast variable is in class level
and since when the class is initialized in the worker node it will not see the value you assigned in the main method
it will only see a null since the broadcast variable is not initialized to anything
i was facing the issue in hdp 2 3 and pig 0 15
this is because spark will partition the data into smaller blocks and operate on these separately
the number of partitions and this their size depends on several things where the file is stored
you can call repartition n or coalesce n on an rdd or a dataframe to change the number of partitions and thus their size
for instance the configuration setting spark sql shuffle partitions by default set to 200 determines how many partitions a dataframe resulting from joins and aggregations will have caching the previous bit relates to just standard processing of data in spark but i feel you may be let to the wrong ideas because of spark being advertised as in memory so i wanted to address that a bit
spark s use of memory becomes more interesting in the following in scala as i m more fammiliar with it but the concept and method names are exactly the same in python the idea here is to use cache so preprocessing doesn t have to be done twice possibly by default spark doesn t save any intermediate results but calculates the full chain for each separate action where the actions here are the savetextfile calls
i said possibly because the ability to actually cache data is limited by the memory in your nodes
depending on your partitioning it may be less though
but if you have say 4 partitions each of 1 5gb only 1 partition can be cached on each node the 4th partition won t fit in the 0 5gb that is still left on each machine so this partition has to be recalculated for the second mapping and only 3 4 of your preprocessed data will be read from memory
the default constructor of stopwatch class became private since guava v 17 and marked deprecated even earlier
you are missing a however if you do it is because hdfs is the uri
hence spark is thinking the token user as nn host
lzo is packaged as part of elastic mapreduce so there s no need to install anything
lzo compression has been removed from hadoop 0 20 x onwards due to licensing issues
i have weird results use lzo and my problem get resolved with some other codec then things just work
you need to stop the hadoop first using bin stop all sh then try to format the file sytem since the hadoop name node and data node still running it locks the file system can that give that error
i ve had this kind of issues in the past for me it was because my disk partition was full
start querying using sql statement limited sql statement though and the results are returned in secs of multi million rows
https developers google com bigquery first 100gb for data processing is free so you can get started now and it also integrates with google spreadsheet which will allow you create visulaization like charts and graphs etc for management
storage is cheep so it doesn t matter particularly if you duplicate data as long as it keeps it responsive
besides my etl process wasn t affected in the option 1 you will need to create an extra process to build and maintain aggregate tables since the rdmbs takes care of the process of update the data on every partition
hadoop is absolutely suitable for such big data you can use it with hbase that allows us to expand to millions of rows and billions of columns and provides great horizontal scalability as well it is suitable for real time random read write access on the other hand hive is good for batch processing so you can run hive jobs in back ground for other tasks we should not mistake hadoop as an alternative to traditional rdbmss but it really helpful in dealing with huge data sets you can use another apache project sqoop that allows us to import our data form existing databases to hadoop cluster without much pain
you are creating an object based on a configuration which is hard coded
because these objects are identical the jvm will reference to the same object
the reason for this is because you re getting an existing instance of an object based on a configuration file
both of them process data in a distributed way but with storm you can have live analitics while you will have to wait the mapreduce job to finish before playing with your results
the apache hadoop tutorial assumes that the environmental variables are set as follows perhaps the digital ocean hadoop tutorial which i also followed ought to recommend adding those two latter variables to the bashrc so that it ends up looking like this it worked for my installation
i had same problem so i did following things
however i would still like to understand why we couldn t use 9000 port even though no other process was running in that port netstat
in fact since setfetchsize is a hint the driver is free to ignore this and do what it sees fit
the default value is set by the statement object that created the result set
as we know we are on a single node and hence data will not be distributed and will remain a single identity and therefore the count variable closure these kinds of variable are known as closure will count for every element and this updation will be sent to the executor every time whenever an increment occur and then executor will submit the closure to driver node
drivernode both executor and driver will reside on a single node and hence the count variable of driver node will be in a scope of executor node and therefore will update the driver node count variable value
now the data will be split into several parts and hence drivernode on different node have it s count variable but not visible to the executor 1 and executor 2 because they reside on different nodes and hence executor1 and executor2 can t update the count variable at driver node closure 1 will update the executor 1 because it s serializable to executor 1 and similarly closure 2 will update executor 2 and to tackle such situation we use accumulator like this
because of this the default imlementation provided by the reducer base class is used
i got the same problem and was wondering because when i test my mapper and reducer on test data it run
a dirty input could cause this problem
however typically your hadoop instance enters safe mode for a reason so this may not be a permanent fix
for some reason the task when executed on your pseudonode is not progressing
it looks like the bug is caused by a race condition when copyfilesreducer uses multiple copyfilesrunable instances to download the files from s3
hence when one thread completes before another it deletes the temp directory that another thread is still using
i see this same problem caused by race condition
try this then add the result to the classpath variable in bashrc
so simply adding the results of hadoop classpath glob won t work
resulting in the following and hive starting successfully
fyi i have post this issue in the hbase user list
here is the answer from enis s ö ztutar an hbase committer and how i solved it the replication was indeed unable on the all cluster but in the past it was enable because we used the hbase indexer to copy data from hbase to solr and this mecanism is based on replication
this error may be due to wrong permissions for usr local hadoop store hdfs datanode folder
this error may be due to wrong permissions for usr local hadoop store hdfs namenode folder or it does not exist
faced same problem namenode service not showing in jps command solution its due to permission problem with directory usr local hadoop store hdfs just change the permission and format namenode and restart the hadoop sudo chmod r 755 usr local hadoop store hdfs hadoop namenode format start all sh jps
then run below commands create a group by command sudo adgroup hadoop add ur user into this sudo usermod a g hadoop ur user u can see current user by who command now change the owner ship of this hadoop store directly by sudo chown r ur user ur gourp usr local hadoop store then format name node again by hdfs namenode format and start all services you can see the result now type jps it will work
was able to telnet 106 77 211 187 9000 and here is the output of netstat a grep 9000 as to why the source code look like the following for fs default name set to localhost because bind address is assigned to localhost the namenode process only can accept connection from localhost
just to be safe i ran hdfs namenode format first before restarting services use netstat tulnp on master node and make sure web ports run based on the ip netstat tulnp tcp 0 0 172 16 3 20 8088 0 0 0 0 listen 14651 java tcp 0 0 172 16 3 20 9870 0 0 0 0 listen 14167 java even after all that i still couldn t access from the windows host and the culprit was the firewall on the hadoop nodes
i had entries added to windows hosts file so the even the following worked hope this helps
hadoop is created to be massively parallel so the architecture acts very different than you would think
this means that using a local location for your file will not work since the local storage is exclusively on your edge node
one thing you will notice is that the exec is just hive sh since we are assuming that the file will be moved to the base directory where the shell action is completed to make sure that last note is true you must include the file s hdfs path this will force oozie to distribute that file with the action
since we have a one to many relationship the hive sh should be kept in a lib and not distributed with every workflow
it is just the file name since we should distribute our distinct hive files with our workflows and the node running the sh will have this distributed to it automagically
depending on your hue version it might have corrupted it hue list
this results in a null
applying date functions on invalid string result in null
this is how you convert your data format to dates and the whole query this were also the results when i tested it on oracle
kgeyti s answer works fine but lzotextinputformat introduces a performance hit since it checks for an index file for each lzo file
this can be especially painful with many lzo files on s3 i ve experienced up to several minutes delay caused by thousands of requests to s3
that resulted in lzo opening a stream from within a file and a ultimately a corrupt lzo block
this can happen while mappers are generating data since it is only a data transfer
from your logs there is a line if you can check out the source code of sequencefile reader you will find out that the log is caused by this code and this fs here should be localfilesystem instead of distributedfilesystem
i think this problem happens because the sequencefile api has changed and some apis of sequencefile reader like mapfile reader fs path conf in this case have been deprecated
unfortunately the connector can t quite consume a gcloud generated credential directly even though it can possibly share a credentialstore file since it asks explicitly for the gcs scopes that it needs you ll notice that the new auth flow will ask only for gcs scopes as opposed to a big list of services like gcloud auth login
make sure you ve also set fs gs project id in your core site xml since the gcs connector likewise doesn t automatically infer a default project from the related gcloud auth
depending on your hive version i believe 0 8 you may need to add an attribute to the class stateful true
when i used generic column names such as c1 i d get null values for all values in that particular column
the main cause of this issue is schema mismatch
creating table based on this schema would help a lot
therefore the matching user must exist as a linux user in hdfs namenode where authentication process occurs
i m deploying hdfs in a docker container so i use group root
note that you may not necessarily want to do the third step since your namenode is already running
in that you will see the cluster id
remember not to reformat namenode this will cause a loss in data
this reverses the string so abcd efgh is now hgfe dcba splits it on into an array so we have hgfe and dcba extracts the first element which is hgfe then finally re reverses giving us the desired efgh also note that the second to last element can be retrieved by substituting 1 for the 0 and so on for the others
since a reducer is unique per key sent from the mapper the way i d go about doing this is using the filename as my output key in the mapper
then in the reducer you simply use a loop to count how many times the filename was received in the mapper s map function in the reducer s reduce function in the driver main you can pretty much use the same driver as the wordcount example note that i used the new mapreduce api so you ll need to adjust some things job instead of jobconf etc
be sure to check up on me since i was typing most of this from memory hope this helps
it will list files and folders alike so you might need to modify if you need to differentiate between them
for me this returns something like split that into lines based on new line characters using split n obtain the last word in the string using line rsplit none 1 1
if you re running into this issue due to a shell script or java program the first thing you need to check is the connection string i have faced similar issue few months back when in my script i was running the queries in such manner this was due to missing of proper hive connection string once i corrected the connection string and ran the query it ran without any issues this answer is only specific to the developers who are using a script or code for hue cloudera distro kindly refer to the above answers
in windows 8 1 i were also facing the same issue part inside hive query part thus i went to the hive home conf hive site xml and changed the property name hive server2 logging operation log location earlier value system user name operation logs to like below said and also replaced all the values which contains the system user name to tmp user name and this brings me up by the job logging issue in hive thanks
note may be because you had downloaded wrong distribution under sqoop distribution
the better approach is to redesign your program so that you don t need unbounded storage in the reducer
find the jar locations that are being used in sqoop in my case it is pointing to the link usr share java mysql connector java jar so when i check the link usr share java mysql connector java jar it points to mysql connector java 5 1 17 jar as 5 1 17 is having this issue try 5 1 37 or higher
i also faced the same problem so i changed my hbase version downloaded hbase 0 94 11 along with zookeeper 3 4 3 hadoop 1 0 1 and worked fine
although i didn t find any specific reason for the issue but it worked fine
everything seems to be correctly confiured so you need to execute
it seems your namenode or datanode is in safemode so we need to leave the safe mode to insert data in hdfs or hbase table in hdfs
though it is true that dropping an external data does not result in dropping the data this does not mean that external tables are for reading only
that being said it is definitely possible to use internal tables when you only have read access so i suspect this is the case for external tables as well
you split your set of pairs in a tasks and execute that on b nodes and regroup result on your master node
also adding that directory to your path is not a good idea because that makes ambiguous the fact you have two separate programs called yarn installed
since yarnpkg is not apparently symlinked by brew except we sneakily added one if brew doesn t update that symlink to point to the new version then yarnpkg will stop working when you brew upgrade yarn unless you repeat the manual ln as above pointing to the new version
brew actually refuses to upgrade yarn giving the reason that it conflicts with hadoop
since you are able to fetch data it means your connection with have works fine
as mentioned the errorlog is new and may not be made available for good reasons
reason for the exception is that the sparksession object is null for some reason in zeppelin
this causes a message like but at least pig doesn t crash with an exception
update turns out the input in test json is invalid json hence the records get collapsed
for json parsing based on cwiki confluence we need follow some steps need to download hive hcatalog core jar hive add jar path hive hcatalog core jar create table tablename colname1 datatype row formatserde org apache hive hcatalog data jsonserde stored as orcfile colname in creating table and colname in test json must be same if not it will show null values hope it wil helpfull
with rcongiu s hive json serde the usage will be define table load sample json into it it is important for this data to be one lined then fetching orders ids is as easy as it will return the list of ids for you proven to return correct results on my environment
which blocksize do you think will be more performant in that case 64meg or 1024meg
for the case of large files then yes the large block sizes tend towards better performance since the overhead of mappers is not negligible
you cannot read gzipped files with wholetextfiles because it uses combinefileinputformat which cannot read gzipped files because they are not splittable source proving it you may be able to use newapihadoopfile with wholefileinputformat not built into hadoop but all over the internet to get this to work correctly
update 1 i don t think wholefileinputformat will work since it just gets the bytes of the file meaning you may have to write your own class possibly extending wholefileinputformat to make sure it decompresses the bytes
it also depends on how you program to attain maximum parallelism
if one task depend on the result of previous task they will execute serially
it will help yopu to get faster result like describe below
the whole mess stems from interaction between docker swarm using overlay networks and how the hdfs name node keeps track of its data nodes
when the hdfs client asks for read write operations directly on the datanodes the namenode reports back the ips hostnames of the datanodes based on the overlay network
since the overlay network is not accessible to the external clients any rw operations will fail
turned out sbt itself was running on java 5 which is the default on my mac for a silly but valid reason
regardless of your maven compiler plugin s source target configurations that only controls how your own source code is compiled you must use a 1 6 jvm to run hadoop s code since it is compiled targetting 1 6 jvm
compressing the intermediate results may enhance the performance in some cases depending on your hardware configuration network and cpu memory
my reason for this error was not enough space on disk 200mb was not enough
one more reason for this error which i encountered is a messed up etc hosts file causing namenode to listen only on the loopback interface
this caused datanodes not to connect to namenode and replication level was not reached as a side effect
hence there is the default 10gb of space mounted on available for local use by the machine
make sure that the option mapred local dir is set to a directory inside var tmp because that is where all the logs of the tasktracker attempts go in which can be huge in size for big jobs
the logging in my case was causing the disk space error
it did not cause any problems to me as the volume of data that i was reading was in the range of 2 3gb
ok it seems as though i have run into a version of this problem https issues apache org jira browse nutch 2041 which is a result of the crawl script not being aware of changes to ignore external links my nutch site xml file
so i would suggest to not fallback to batch update pattern just because it looks safer personally i think triggering daily ingestions is operationally less convenient than just keeping it running for continuous and real time
ingestion and it also leads to several downsides for your actual use case see next paragraph
but you lose a the ability to enrich your incoming records with the very latest db data at the point in time when the enrichment happens and conversely b you might actually enrich the incoming records with stale old data until the next daily update completed which most probably will lead to incorrect data that you are sending downstream making available to other applications for consumption
according to the hdfs architecture doc for the common case when the replication factor is three hdfs s placement policy is to put one replica on the local machine if the writer is on a datanode per the same doc because the namenode does not allow datanodes to have multiple replicas of the same block maximum number of replicas created is the total number of datanodes at that time
hooking pig up to be able to work with lzos this was by far the most annoying and time consuming part for me not because it s difficult but because there are 50 different tutorials online none of which are all that helpful
these are listed on the page mentioned above and might change so i won t specify them here
i found a way to handle errors and access the cause by using counters
i think that you can take advantage of specifying password file argument so that oozie will never see the password
also adding the auth nosasl to the url made my application hang so i removed it
also itshould be hive2 not hive since you are using hiveserver2
use of unqualified hostname localhost or 127 0 0 1 cause problems
you were able to list directory contents because hostname 9000was accessible to your client code
if that unit of code depends on external calls then we mock those calls to return certain values
the reason for the bad testability is that your class do two things create a table and execute a tuple
initial string array example convert array result and if you want to add more columns in your insert select query then use lateral view outer
packages which are part of your distribution should be preferred because they have been tested to work properly on your system
hdfs getconf confkey mapreduce jobtracker expire trackers interval as mentioned in the other answer yarn resourcemanager nodemanagers heartbeat interval ms should be set based on your network if your network has high latency you should set a bigger value
its in decommissioning when there are running containers and its waiting for them to complete so that those nodes can be decommissioned
i can think for three possible reasons for this problem
since the job fails roughly a third of the way through consistently this means it s probably failing in the same place every time a file whose partition is roughly a third of the way through the partition list
paul staab replied on this issue in spark jira
there is chance that this is due to fact that java 1 8 is not installed configured properly for all yarn nodes
however to run spark shell you have to use deploy mode client since the driver is going to run on the client in case of spark shell
this is because the row group indices mainly consist of min and max values of each column in the row group
because the same code is not working with aws eks machine and same exception throws if hadoop verion is 2 8 1
the int96 binary encoding is split into 2 parts first 8 bytes are nanoseconds since midnight last 4 bytes is julian day
just for comparison hbase site xml persistence xml after that i got another error connection refused although all connection strings were correct thus i researched for days for the cause
explain the queries which are causing issues rather than guessing what s going on
having said that i m going to guess as to what s going on since i don t have the query plans
i m guessing that a your indexes aren t being used correctly and you re getting a bunch of avoidable table scans b your db servers are tuned for oltp not analytical queries c writing data while reading is causing things to slow down greatly d working with strings just sucks and e you ve got some inefficient queries with horrible joins everyone has some of these
it s luckily been a long time since i cared about mysql replication so i can t remember if you can batch up the writes to the analytical query slave without too much drama
i d look at infobright first it s open source based on mysql so it s probably the easiest to put into your existing system make sure the data is going to the infobright db then point your analytical queries to the infobright server keep the rest of the system as it is job done or if vertica ever releases its community edition
basically use hadoop just for daily or batch processing and store the results into the db
since it is actually small adition on top of hadoop it inherits its linear scalability i would suggest to deploy hive alongside mysql replicate daily data to there and run heavy aggregations agains it
you need them since hive is iherently not interactive each query will take at least a few dozens of seconds
i am a beginner in hadoop it s just my guess of the answer so please bear with it point out if it seems to be naive
because which split of data go to which mapper is elegantly designed to meet the locality criteria
if you don t store it on hdfs most likely that all the data will be transmitted by network which is slow and may cause bandwidth problem
you have to temporarily save output of first map reduce so that the 2nd one can use it
this is based on the generator java of apache nutch
tasktrackers will be using the external jar so you can provide it by modifying hadoop tasktracker opts option in the hadoop env sh configuration file and make it point to the jar
comparison 1 is a legacy method but discouraged because it has a large negative performance cost
add driver class path hbase 1 1 2 conf into spark submit command so that the task can find the configured zookeeper servers instead of 127 0 0 1
we just started running on yarn so i don t know much
when a sparkcontext is destroyed all the rdds created in it are lost because they are meaningless without the running application
this erases the lineage of the rdd so it will be reloaded rather than recalculated if a partition is lost
performance benefit all columns are not transferred to the client which results in reduced network calls
rtfm quoting languagemanual joins you may try to move the between filter to a where clause resulting in a lousy partially cartesian join followed by a post processing cleanup
depending on the actual cardinality of your skill group table it may work fast or take whole days
based on your code here is simpler test case on spark 2 0 actually dataset first is equivalent to dataset limit 1 collect so check the physical plan of the two cases for the first case it is related to an optimisation in the collectlimitexec physical operator
however in the second case the optimisation in the collectlimitexec does not help because the previous limit operation involves a shuffle operation
the reason is because hive will use value to create the directory in which your csv is going to be stored which will be something like this employee job title subgroup value
edited since the table has dynamic partition one solution would be loading the csv into an external table e g
bytebuffer class doesn t implement the writablecomparable interface so the exception
the hue release download you re trying to compile works only until cdh3u1 onwards after which cdh3 had some internal api method changes over some methods that hue depends on
it turned out this is because i don t have enough space
the reason for plugin not working is that the jar package lost some libs commons cli 1 2 jar commons configuration 1 6 jar jackson core asl 1 8 8 jar jackson mapper asl 1 8 8 jar commons httpclient 3 0 1 jar commons lang 2 4 jar you could cp this jars from hadoop lib to jar lib and don t forget modifying manifest
note here that instead of from hadoop root build copying of the hadoop core version jar is now from hadoop root directly because if you are using the compiled version of hadoop the hadoop root build folder would be actually empty
copying of the commons cli commons cli version jar is now from hadoop root lib for the same reason
and the second is to make sure jars especially hadoop core 1 0 4 jar in the hadoop root folder are visible to javac because the eclipse plugin references the hadoop classes
this setup is different from the first two in purpose and thus not dispensable
this is quite a nice strategy since you start to get a nice spread of regions over the region servers without having to wait until they reach the 10gb limit
alternatively you would be better off pre splitting your tables since you want to make sure that you are getting the most out of the processing power of your cluster if you have a single region all requests will go to the region server to which the region is assigned
in that condition writes are not uniformly distributed and on compaction of table becomes a bottle neck for writing modules
because in theory you can simply state disclaimer i have seen cases where the hive optimizer makes aggressive optimizations and produces wrong results in other words if the simple v1 v1 clause does not filter out the nan values as expected then look into reflect2 edit indeed the optimizer appears to ignore the v1 v1 clause in some versions of hive see comments so a more devious formula is necessary v1 1 0 v1 should work except when rounding errors make either abs v1 1 or abs v1 1 other numeric tricks will fail similarly in edge cases especially when v1 0 0 in the end the most robust approach appears to try cast v1 as string nan because all possible nan values are displayed as nan even if they are not strictly equal in the arithmetical sense
hive is normally based on hdfs which is not designed for small number of inserts updates selects
so your plan can end up in the following problems many small files which ends in bad performance your window gets to small because it takes to long suggestion option 1 use kafka just as buffer queue and design your pipeline like kafka hdfs e g
it depends on how often you run the batch spark option2 is a good choice i would recommend store like 30 days in hbase and all older data in hive impala
this is usually determined by the number of blocks in the input file and this number is fixed no matter how many worker nodes you have
since the data should ideally be processed on the same machines that store it initially adding new task trackers will not necessarily add proportional processing speed since the data will not be local on those nodes initially and will need to be copied over the network
primarily because if on starting a job jar code will be copied to all the nodes that the cluster knows of is true then even if you use 100 mappers and there are 1000 nodes code for all jobs will always be copied to all the nodes
hence tasktracker can copy the codebase from several locations a list of which may be sent by jobtracker to it
i m currently working on a nested map reduce framework that extends the hadoop codebase and allows you to spawn more nodes based on inputs that the mapper or reducer gets
also make sure you set the outputkeyclass and outputvalueclass on the job accordingly
or by doing some clever pruning so that while in reality it is quadratic in real data it usually remains linear because you can drop a lot of the theoretically quadratic data during or before generation
because there is no constraint on the output size
because they are numbered 1 to n then you can use which obviously creates a data set of quadratic size
so it does this is not as bad an abuse of mapreduce it is just the canonical way of parallel computation of your quadratic result matrix since it is at least honest about what it does using massive auxillary data
and it is not longer a proper mapreduce because it uses auxiallary data that can t really be seen as parameterization of your function
if you preprocess your data and standardize every record to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 the pearson correlation simplifies to the covariance because stddev is 1
and because the mean is 0 covariance becomes just e x y 1 5 sum x i y i
you will need to have permissions to do this either sudo or root access or have a hard limit of 2048 or higher so you can set it as your own user on the system
if your job is failing because of outofmemmory on nodes you can tweek your number of max maps and reducers and the jvm opts for each
mapred child java opts the default is 200xmx usually has to be increased based on your data nodes specific hardware
it is because of the file descriptor as my program was generating lot of file in target table
due to multilevel of partition structure
mappers sort because the reducer needs it sorted to be able to do a merge
if there are no reducers it has no reason to to sort so it doesn t
this is the right behavior because i don t want it sorted in a map only job which would make my processing slower
so again just like the local sorting combiners do not run if there are no reducers because it has no reason to
this is a better approach because combiners are specified as a good to have optimization and you can t count on them running even when they do run
according to the documentation http pig apache org docs r0 12 0 basic html group so it is just for readability no differences between the two
files that you pass with files option are placed in working directory so you can simply use it in this way map py i don t remember what permissions are set to this file so if there are no execute permissions use it as python map py so the full command is
i resolved the issue by installing hadoop 2 9 1 there was namenode issue in hadoop 3 2 1 version hdfs namenode issue in 3 2 1
point 1 output from mapper is always sorted but based on key
if map method is doing this context write outkey outvalue then result will be sorted based on outkey
already answered by surjansr heading does the sort phase integrated with mapper phase already so that the output of map phase is already sorted in the intermediate data
the result of mapper is written temporarily before it is written to the next phase
in the case of a reduce operation the temporarily stored mapper output is sorted shuffle based on the partitioner needs before moved to the reduce operation in the case of map only job as in your case the temorarily stored mapper output is sorted based on the key and written to the final output folder as specified in your arguments for the job
but when you are explicitely setting up numreducetasks to 0 in the job configuration then the mapper o p will not be sorted and written directly to hdfs so we cannot say that mapper output is always sorted
2 is the sort phase integrated into the mapper phase already so that the output of map phase is already sorted in the intermediate data
sort the framework merge sorts reducer inputs by keys since different mappers may have output the same key
as per the documentation the shuffle and sort phase is driven by framework if you want to persist the data set number of reducers to zero which causes persistence of map output into hdfs but it won t sort the data
this is one of the reasons why libraries which depend on the hadoop libs need to have separately compiled jarfiles for hadoop 1 and hadoop 2
based on your stack trace it appears that somehow you got a hadoop1 compiled avro jarfile despite running with hadoop 2 4 1
the problem is that avro 1 7 7 supports 2 versions of hadoop and hence depends on both hadoop versions
you might try a map side join depending on your hardware constraints
i faced the same problem with a left outer join similar to i made an analysis based on the already given answers and i saw two of the given problems left table was more than 100x bigger than the right table i also detected that one of the join variable was rather skewed in the right table i tried most of the solutions given in other answers plus some extra parameters i found here without success
lastly i found out that the left table had a really high of null values for the join columns bt ident and bt cate so i tried one last thing which finally worked for me to split the left table depending on bt ident and bt cate being null or not to later make a union all with both branches
if you want to use s3n now regarding the exception you need to make sure both jars are on the driver and worker classpaths and make sure to distribute them to the worker node if you re using client mode via the jars flag also if you re building your uber jar and including aws java sdk and hadoop aws no reason to use the packages flag
i ask because the logs are distributed across your cluster but by logging them to the rootlogger you should be able to see them via the job tracker by drilling down on the job task attempts
if you want to utilize rolling files then you have a difficult time retrieving those files later again because they are distributed across your task nodes
if you want to dynamically set log levels this should be simple enough if you want to add you own appenders then you should be able to do this programmatically see this so question in the setup method as above
this is very possible because there is already a conf site xml in the hbase jar
something like if it gets too obscure i would advise running this from command line and not in eclipse so you can be exactly sure of what you have in your classpath
that is because it contains the byte offset of the current line and this could easily overflow an integer
you and i might know that if you join example on itself on column a then e1 b is the same as e2 b so it should not need an alias but hive does not know this so you need to pick one to remove any ambiguity
this discussion will depend on the configuration class to make available an object across the cluster accessible to all mappers and or reducers
cause key encryption type aes256 cts might not be configured in your krb setup solution simply delete keytab file and recreate one without aes256 cts encryption by using above steps or delete aes256 cts encription from the keytab file by following the steps on the link i added above
to do this you add this to core site xml the reason why accumulo is confused is because it s using the same default configuration to figure out where hdfs is and it s defaulting to file
you have to edit your etc hosts file because hbase probably can t connect to localhost using 127 0 0 1 you should replace the line with restart hbase after that to and hopefully that fixes it
this happens since hbase is not able to find the master host
therefore you should group by true false then count so now the output of a dump for counts will look something like if you want the counts of true and false in their own relations then you can filter the output of counts
for mapreduce 2 x you want to to use the most common options for this are to add the r flag if you want to delete an entire directory like the results of an mr
even the secondarynamenode doesn t help in that case since it s only used for checkpoints not as a backup for the namenode
but since hadoop 2 you have a better way to handle failures in the namenode
you can run 2 redundant namenodes alongside one another so that if one of the namenodes fails the cluster will quickly failover to the other namenode
the way it works is pretty transparent basically the datanodes will send reports to both namenodes so that if one fails the other one will be ready to be used in active mode
i assume you are using the default configuration so the problem is where you call hive to start working since you need to call it from the same directory in order to see the tables you created in the previous hive session
however a better solution would be to configure hive so that it uses a database like mysql as a metastore
hadoop hive with clause syntax and examples with the help of hive with clause you can reuse piece of query result in same query construct
the driver cannot pass its filesystem to the workers because it is not serializable
just do something like btw the error that you re getting in spark is because spark requires objects it uses to implement serializable which filesystem does not
i can t confirm this but it would seem that every rename in hdfs would involve the namenode since it tracks the full directory structure and node location of files confirmation link meaning it can t be done efficiently in parallel
as per this answer renaming is a metadata only operation so it should be very fast run serially
here s pure shell solution remarks client opts override is needed by hdfs dfs ls because of large amount of files
because you re running in local embedded mode hdfs is not being considered
if this operation kills your database you can create a dictionary in a local application that uses a text indexing engine e g apache lucene and store only the result in your database
the reason for the timeouts might be a long running computation in your reducer without reporting the progress back to the hadoop framework
it s possible that you might have consumed all of java s heap space or gc is happening too frequently giving no chance to the reducer to report status to master and is hence killed
the changes you make to your bash profile will come into effect when you login into the shell again
if you want to work with milliseconds don t use the unix timestamp functions because these consider date as seconds since epoch
therefore you have to replace macaddress to macaddress as well as all other column names
https cwiki apache org confluence display hive languagemanual ddl languagemanualddl createtable so the correct code is
it s just a warning because it can not find the correct jar
either by compiling it or because it does not exist
it took me time but i found the solution here https unix stackexchange com questions 293069 all services of a user are killed when running multiple services under this user basically some hadoop processes just stop because why not
because of the bug in procps ng 3 3 10 kill the process group whose id starts with 1 invoked by bin yarn application kill appid will cause the user logouts
this is because lvm creates logical layer over the individual mounted disks in a machine
if an older datanode comes online it is sending it s block list to the namenode and depending on how many of the blocks are already replicated or not it will delete unneeded blocks on this datanode
this can be a problem because modern drives often exhibit some bad sectors while still functioning fine for the most part and it s work intensive to fsck this disks and restart the datanode
zfs and btrfs provide some resilience against this errors on modern drives as they are able to deal better with corrupted metadata and avoid lengthy fsck checks due to internal checksumming
cow is not needed because hadoop takes care of replication and security
depending on your jobs it can make sense to use something like raid 0 for pairs of disks but be sure to first verify that sequential read or write is really the bottleneck for your job and not the network hdfs replication cpu but make sure first that what you are doing is worth the work and the hassle
it s the case of the ssh action for example even though there it is a little more complicated because the java code happens synchronously but the remote shell script is executed asynchronously
in your case i think dmitry s answer is the more helpful one but it s good to keep in mind that there can be other reasons for being in the prep state too
the name node service was failing to start because safe mode was on
i m not sure what caused it to stay in safe mode but running this command below resolved my issue
based on the report it seems that resource are low on nn
it was occurring because there was no disk space for hadoop to run new commands to manipulate the files
since hadoop was in safemode i could not even delete files inside hadoop
i am using cloudera version of hadoop so i first deleted few files in cloudera file system
also as said by other people hadoop is not designed for realtime application because there is some overhead in running map reduce jobs
so i would really advise going at impala so you can still use an hadoop ecosystem but if you re also considering alternatives here are a few other frameworks that could be of use druid was open sourced by metamarkets
in the end i think you should really analyze your needs and see if using hadoop is what you need because it s only getting started in the realtime space

maybe never tried this you can use the results in real time by telling your reducers to write them into a temporary file that can be read by another thread
but thanks to all who answered
1 create the file log4j properties and put it in the location of src main resources the content of the log4j properties it happens because of the hadoop logging framework
the performance increase really depends on many factors how parallel mutually exclusive all of the components algorithm are is
they are easier to setup and use even in a single machine with promising results
changed the error causing method in fileutil java in hadoop core jar file and recompiled and included in my eclipse project
where this really hurts is that it is the up front partitioning where a lot of the delay happens so it s the serialized bit of work which is being brought to its knees
my recommendation is to try to flatten your directory structure so that you move from a deep tree to something shallow maybe even all in the same directory so that it can be scanned without the walk at a cost of 1 http request per 5000 entries
for the variable hadoop streaming obtaining the path is a bit more complicated depending on the hdp you are using
if you just need to transform your date yyyy mm dd into an integer yyyymmdd why don t you try to first remove all the occurrences of from the string representation of your date before casting the result to int by using something like this
you ll have to re structure your code so that sc isn t referenced in your map function closure
i was also facing the issue on cloudera quick start vm 5 12 which was resolved by executing below statement on hive prompt i hope that below information will be more useful step 1 importing all tables from retail db database of mysql step 2 creation of database called retail db and required tables in hive step 3 execute join query above query was giving below issue query id cloudera 20171029182323 6eedd682 256b 466c b2e5 58ea100715fb total jobs 1 failed execution error return code 1 from org apache hadoop hive ql exec mr mapredlocaltask step 4 above issue was resolved by executing below statement on hive prompt step 5 query result
this problem caused by the conflict of write access
in my case it was the issue of not setting the queue so i did following set mapred job queue name queue name this has solved my problem
the reason you are getting a null pointer exception is that the distributedfilesystem internally uses an instance of dfsclient
since you did not call initialize the instance of dfsclient is null
getfilestatus calls dfsclient getfileinfo getpathname f which causes nullpointerexception since dfsclient is null
using spark 1 6 1 and scala 2 10 i got the same error error overloaded method value createdataframe with alternatives for me gotcha was the signature in createdataframe i was trying to use the val rdd list row but it failed because java util list org apache spark sql row and scala collection immutable list org apache spark sql row are not the same
i assume that your schema is like in the spark guide as follow if you look at the signature of the createdataframe here is the one that accepts a structtype as 2nd argument for scala so it accepts as 1st argument a rdd row
what you have in rowrdd is a rdd array string so there is a mismatch
this will come in effect after logging in next time so log out and log in
if this still doesn t work perhaps it s because you are using a administrator account
user rights assignment in group policy then restart the computer to make it take effect
i don t know the cause of error but reformating namenode helps me to solve it in windows 8
looks like i had a lucky day and went with this exception through all of those causes
you may want to look at this excellent post about big o as a starting point for how to reason about the long term scalablility of your program
but since we ve precomputed this we can just iterate up over all possible legal values of c2 compute k c2 x2 and see if we know how to make it
thus we can say inspecting the loops we see that the outer loop runs k times the inner loop runs sum times per iteration and the innermost loop runs also at most sum times per iteration
this means that we re asking if there are any ways to sum up a linear combination of the first k 1 variables so that the sum of those values is sum
concretely here is a java recursive implementation for this problem with a copy of the result vector coeff for each recursion as expected in theory
but now that code is in a special case the last value test for each coeff is 0 so the copy is not necessary
the problem was occurring because i was deploying the job on an nfs
in my case this issue manifested itself because i was not using the correct schema to read the document
after a week of searching the solution for me was that in some files the schema was a little bit different a column more or less and while there is a schema merge implemented in parquet orc does not support a schema merge for now https issues apache org jira plugins servlet mobile issue spark 11412 so my workaround was to load the orc files one after another and then i used the df write parquet method to convert them
i think that has something to do with not being able to optimize correctly because of the missing information for a class
you might want to check the namenode logs for inconsistent state to confirm the cause before reformatting
this patch results in the formation of a success file for successful job
and thus whenever i ran hadoop from the cli it executed the binaries of the older hadoop rather than the new one
if run on slave might lead to problems
this error appears due to the way the query is translated in cassandra check org apache cassandra hadoop cql3 cqlpagingrecordreader whereclause for details
in write api of mainrecordwriter you would get the actual recordwriter instance from the map based on the record you are going to write and write the record using this record writer
hence avromultipleoutputs should have the same constraints as multipleoutputs
in my case all users had permissions on all subfolders of user history but the hue file browser told me that the user history directory itself had the following permission set this resulted in the error when using a different user than mapred
this configuration is undocumented for good reason while widely used in unit tests within hadoop itself it can be very dangerous to use in a production system
application and library code is typically written with the assumption that calls like path getfilesystem conf and filesystem get conf are cheap and lightweight so they are used frequently
in a production system i have seen a client system ddos a namenode server because it disabled caching
hadoop includes its own shutdownhookmanager which is used to sequence events during shutdown filesystem shutdown is purposefully placed at the end so that other shutdown hooks e g
but hadoop s shutdownhookmanager is only aware of shutdown tasks that have been registered to it so it will not be aware of spring s lifecycle management
it does sound like leveraging spring s shutdown sequences and leveraging fs automatic close false may be the right fit for your application i don t have spring experience so i can t help you in that regard
since the classes are loaded onto the beeswax server jvm same goes with hiveserver1 and hiveserver2 jvms deploying a new version of a jar could often require restarting these service to avoid such class loading issues
scribe is a useful tool for collecting logs though it may be superfluous depending on your qa cluster
you should choose qa practices based on the importance of qa for your organization and also on the amount of resources you have
due to lack of resource in slave node the job running in the queue will meet deadlock situation
because for small cluster each queue assign some memory size 2048mb to complete single map reduce job
so if we run two mapreduce program memory used by hadoop get more than 8gb so it met deadlock
okay so i got some other people in the office to help work on this and we figured out a solution
the driver java options dorg xerial snappy lib name libsnappyjava jnilib was necessary because i was getting errors about java lang unsatisfiedlinkerror no snappyjava in java library path
trivial method to find answer is to look at http hadoop apache org mapreduce releases html based on which the earliest release is on september 4 2007
in a place i work now we have a similar set of tech requirements and a solution is cassandra solr spark exactly in that order
for testing less often queries spark scala no sparksql due to old version of it it s a bank everything should be tested and matured from cognac to software argh
you ve given arguments against cassandra and solr already so i ll focus on explaining why hadoop mapreduce wouldn t do as well as spark for real time queries
as a result data are read and wrote at least twice in map stage and in reduce stage
this allows you to recover from failures as partial result are secured but it that s not want you want when aiming for real time queries
this goal is achieved mainly by utilizing ram and the results are astonishing
i had a similar error and i end up on your question and this mail list thread ebadf bad file descriptor in my case i was closing a writer without flushing it with hflush since you don t seem to use by hand a writer or a reader i would probably have a look to how you are sending the mr task
this is caused by a known docker issue i also raised and closed this duplicate which describes the steps as set out in the question
because the static builder class was in common cli 1 4 while some of the hadoop dependencies were still referring to older version the issue occurred
in my case the issue resolved by changing the sequence of jar file addition into the classpath in the shell script responsible for setting up environment before program execution
from the pig getting started page ipc version 4 is for hadoop 1 0 whereas version 7 is for hadoop 2 0 so it sounds like you re running pig with its embedded hadoop version but trying to talk to a hadoop 2 cluster
error server ipc version 7 cannot communicate with client version 4 may be caused when cdh3 job is trying to comunicate with cdh4 hdfs
i fixed this by copying mysql connector java 5 1 25 bin jar to var lib impala the startup script was telling the classpath to look here for the connector jar for some reason
the problem is caused because yarn is using different path for java executable different then you have in your os
the block scanner is what is causing the files to grow
the bug which causes this has been fixed in hdfs 2 6 0
i had 1 node out of 20 use 100 of all available space because of the two dncp block verification logs
the first time hadoop starts it registers the bean but the second time hadoop starts a bean with that name is already registered resulting in the error above
either you are not shutting down minidfscluster properly or you are starting it more than once or there is a bug in minidfscluster that causes it to not clean up properly
you could rely on this without worrying about a partial state since the source file is already created and closed
the cause all of the error showing this below error is the main reason not been able to master connect to slave basically 0 0 0 0 8031 is the port of yarn resourcemanager resource tracker address so i checked using lsof i 8031 the port wasn t enable open allowed
since i m using openstack cloud added 8031 and other ports that was showing error and voil á worked as intend
premature eof can occur due to multiple reasons one of which is spawning of huge number of threads to write to disk on one reducer node using fileoutputcommitter
i encountered this error when the number of files crossed 12000 roughly on one reducer node as the threads got killed and the temporary folder got deleted leading to plethora of these exception messages
because of this setting it is searching for following constructor in s3afilesystem class and there is no such constructor following exception clearly tells that it is unable to find a constructor for s3afilesystem with uri and configuration parameters
hence you cannot set value of fs abstractfilesystem s3a impl to org apache hadoop fs s3a s3afilesystem since org apache hadoop fs s3a s3afilesystem does not implement abstractfilesystem
on all machines modify hdfs site xml file to change the value for property dfs replication to something 1 at least to the number of slaves in the cluster here i have two slaves so i would set it to 2 on namenode master only re format the hdfs through namenode hdfs namenode format optional remove dfs datanode data dir property from master s hdfs site xml file
you may find it impossible to fully utilize all the cores on one machine for this reason
thus your no arg constructor actually has an invisible argument unless the class is declared static
the root cause is with the conf object that needs to load the property yarn resourcemanager scheduler address
it is because your resource manager is not reachable
i came here because i was looking for ways to upgrade jdk from 1 7 to 1 8 on the latest coudera quickstart vm 5 8 can t believe they still ship it with jdk1 7 by default
the hints and suggestions in the above answers helped tremendously but since they were not listing complete steps to achieve the upgrade i thought i would add that to help others like me
i hate to answer my own questions but here is the answer the wrong version of java home is getting set for 2 reasons using the command service removes most environmental variables
additional information about data locality in spark there are several levels of locality based on the data s current location
this is a little slower than process local because the data has to travel between processes no pref data is accessed equally quickly from anywhere and has no locality preference rack local data is on the same rack of servers
another possible reason is that you re hitting s3 request rate limits
while the spark ui will say task failed while writing rows i doubt its the reason you re getting an issue but its a possible reason if you re running a highly intensive job
there are a couple of things i see in your configuration that can cause issues your first agent seems to have an avro sink with batch size of 1
this is because the avro source on the second agent would be committing to the channel with batch size of 1
each commit causes an fsync causing the file channel performance to be poor
the batch size on the exec source is also 1 causing that channel to be slow as well
you should just make sure that each sink writes to a different directory or have different hdfs fileprefix so that multiple hdfs sinks don t try to write to the same files
this source will only process files which are immutable so you need to rotate the log files out
as its name suggests it is already configured so the existing configuration must be used by the tester class and not set a new empty one
from official page https cwiki apache org confluence display hive languagemanual ddl they have included in the syntax to create table as so that means we can create table with primary keys in hive version information as of hive 2 1 0 hive 13290
since these constraints are not validated an upstream system needs to ensure data integrity before it is loaded into hive
this happens due to internal mapping between directories
when you use the full hdfs url you re using an absolute path and it s not finding your file because it s located in your user home folder
show partitions myschema mytable result partitionkey abc partitionkey xyz and if you do ls on hdfs for table folder ls ltr hdfs servername data fid work hive myschema mytable partitionkey abc you will get just partition folder which is mismatch
for example instead of dump r45 typed as dump 45 so it throws the above error
anyhow head closed the stream after it read its limit hence hadoop throw ed a warning saying text unable to write to output stream
because head has already closed the stream to which hadoop s text is trying to write to
try to run since start all sh and stop all sh located in sbin directory while hadoop binary file is located in bin directory
also updated your bashrc for so that you can directly access start all sh
this is because sqoop uses jdbc which provides a call level api for sql based database but mongodb is not an sql based database
instead according to the sqoop docs since sqoop breaks down export process into multiple transactions it is possible that a failed export job may result in partial data being committed to the database
this can further lead to subsequent jobs failing due to insert collisions in some cases or lead to duplicated data in others
according to the docs this connectivity takes the form of allowing both reading mongodb data into hadoop for use in mapreduce jobs as well as other components of the hadoop ecosystem as well as writing the results of hadoop jobs out to mongodb
following the example from the connector repository job setmapperclass tokenizermapper class job setcombinerclass intsumreducer class job setreducerclass intsumreducer class job setoutputkeyclass text class job setoutputvalueclass intwritable class job setinputformatclass mongoinputformat class instead of job setoutputformatclass mongooutputformat class we use an outputformatclass that writes the job results to a mysql database
the bottom line is that you would need to push the data first to to hdfs and there are several ways depend on data source you would perform the data transfer from your source to hdfs such as from local file system you would use the following command hadoop f copyfromlocal sourcefileorstoragepath hdfs __ or directpathathdfs
i d recommend learning more and signing up for the program since you d be recreating what they ve already spent man years on
then you upload your gc 4 to it so the file path is user hadoop gc 4 gc 4
this is the default behavior as point out in the documentation you re starting those commands in those different folders so what you see is only confined to the current working directory
this is explained here https spark apache org docs latest sql programming guide html hive tables so you should set spark sql warehouse dir or simply make sure you always start your spark job from the same directory run bin spark instead of cd bin spark etc
mapper and reducer are running across machines thus you need to distribute your jar to every machine
i guess you should change your hadoop classpath variable so that it points to the jar file
have to wait for completing each flow depends on other class so need job waitforcompletion true but it must to set input and output path before starting mapper combiner and reducer class
lzo deflate means an lzo stream without the usual header and trailer so you would need to wrap the raw lzo deflate stream with the header and trailer expected by lzop
the reason it happened because i was not using the right codec
this may or may not be because i switched the jdk from cloudera s pre built vm to jdk 1 7
that seemed to get me to the next problem caused by java lang runtimeexception native snappy library not available snappycompressor has not been loaded
you need to restart the mapreduce service after this so that the new libraries are taken and can be used
in this example the scope tag tells maven that you re using this dependency for building but it indicates that the dependency will be provided during runtime so you ll either need to remove this tag or add the hadoop jar using cp path to jar jar during runtime
you can tweak your query too to obtain these results
based on the log it seems that you re hitting following exception 13 04 22 18 34 44 info hive hiveimport exception in thread main java lang nosuchmethoderror org apache thrift encodingutils setbit biz b i ve seen this issue before when users were using hbase and hive in incompatible versions
as sqoop is adding both hbase and hive jars to the classpath only one thrift version can be active and thus the second tool usually hive is not working properly
i guess the metastore db files would have already written so it hapend for me to change the name of table and redo the command in case we don t want to delete whole folder of metastoredb
pig will write temporary result there
map reduce framework will store intermediate output into local disk rather than hdfs as this would cause unnecessarily replication of files
the output of the mapper is buffered until it gets to about 80 of its size and at that point it begins to dump the result to its local disk and continues to admit items into the buffer
it should be due to a duplicated class loaded both hadoop and hbase use the same jar in the same jvm
the way slf4j picks a binding is determined by the jvm and for all practical purposes should be considered random
embedded components such as libraries or frameworks should not declare a dependency on any slf4j binding but only depend on slf4j api
when a library declares a compile time dependency on a slf4j binding it imposes that binding on the end user thus negating slf4j s purpose
there is an excellent tutorial from mesosphere that you should take a look at and it explains in details how to run hadoop on top of mesos so this would be a good place to start
this will automatically setup user accounts for you to run the mapreduce jobs you just need to have a namenode running on your master and datanode running on your slaves
first make sure to finalize the upgrade on the namenode what i found was that the datanodes for some reason did not finalize their directories at all
if you delete anything it will not remove it hence your storage never reduces
you are getting the error because there is no such directory specified in the path
its a warning so will no effect on your code
the second is error basically because its not able to put the file inside the input folder
this is because you have not installed hadoop winutils for your hadoop version
this is because you have to specify path correctly
essentially each of them compiles down to one or more map reduce jobs so the response cannot be within 5 seconds hbase may work although your infrastructure is a bit small for optimal performance
you should look up computing running averages so that you don t have to do heavy weight reduces
since your data seems to be pretty much homogeneous i would definitely take a look at google bigquery you can ingest and analyze the data without a mapreduce step on your part and the restful api will help you create a web application based on your queries
in fact depending on how you want to design your application you could create a fairly real time application
if i understand you correctly and you only need to aggregate on single columns at a time you can store your data differently for better results in hbase that would look something like table per data column in today s setup and another single table for the filtering fields type ids row for each key in today s setup you may want to think how to incorporate your filter fields into the key for efficient filtering otherwise you d have to do a two phase read column for each table in today s setup i e
as a result you can probably use just one or two large tables
but since your data set doesn t sound like you need to join you should be fine
if you don t already have a table with at least one row you can accomplish the desired result as such
no mapreduce is involved so no bucketing happened
this is because you have to enforce the bucketing during the insert to your bucketed table or create the buckets for yourself
to change the log levels dynamically so that restart of the daemon is not required use hadoop daemonlog utility
there are ways you can do this using the hadoop fs put command with the source argument being a hypen getmerge also outputs to the local file system not hdfs unforntunatley there is no efficient way to merge multiple files into one unless you want to look into hadoop appending but in your version of hadoop that is disabled by default and potentially buggy without having to copy the files to one machine and then back into hdfs whether you do that in a custom map reduce job with a single reducer and a custom mapper reducer that retains the file ordering remember each line will be sorted by the keys so you key will need to be some combination of the input file name and line number and the value will be the line itself via the fsshell commands depending on your network topology i e
in my cases it s caused by the jetty library conflicts with hadoop hbase libraries maybe both contain org eclipse jdt internal compiler compilationresult method
you have multiple versions of the library containing org eclipse jdt internal compiler compilationresult on your classpath and they are ordered so that a version in which the method compilationresult getproblems does not exist or was incompatibly changed comes first on the classpath probably because it is provided by whatever container you re running in
i had the same problem with jars from hadoop that in turn depend on some jetty packages
in my case it was because of conflict of dependency jar but its tough to find out which jar is the cause of conflict
i got the same error on cluster on local system in eclipse it was working fine the cause for this problem was ecj x x x jar file
hi this is because of jsp page compilers in my case the jsp pages is developed in older version of tomcat then i deployed into new version of tomcat then i got java lang nosuchmethoderror org eclipse jdt internal compiler compilationresult getproblems lorg eclipse jdt core compiler iproblem then i added the jasper
it is there because sorting is a neat trick to group your keys
in hadoop itself there is already a jira filed for that since years source
source to your actual question why mapreduce was inherently a paper from google source which states the following so it was more a convenience decision to support sort but not to inherently only allow sort to group keys
thus the key will first gives us a simple way to distribute computation
this allows a single reduce function to receive a single word and thus add all the times it was seen creating an accurate word count
thus aggregation of keys are what allow the map phase to be distributed across multiple machines independently
without aggregating keys to the same reducer in the word count example we might get several word counts for a given word since there is no gaurantee that a single reducer would receive all word counts from all files
hadoop simply generalizes and abstracts the common need to join data results from parallel computations by using a familiar pardigm keys and values
binary format used by apache avro cassandra like many other nosql stores treats values as opaque byte sequences so you can encode you values how ever you like
or since you only have 150mb day you could just batch load it into mysql readonly compressed tables
if for some reason you need the complexity of an interactive system hbase or cassandra or might be good fits but beware that you ll spend a significant amount of time playing dba and 150mb day is so little data that you probably don t need the complexity
with the given rate of data it would take you 20 years to fill a 1 tb disk so i wouldn t worry about compression
i had the same problem and resolved by adding this in mapred site xml so edit your mapreduce application classpath property
as you said the classpath you need depends on version location and type of installation
try the following should work as long as your file isn t too big since the whole thing will be decompressed
hdfs capacity is consumed based on the actual file size but a block is consumed per file
there are limited number of blocks available dependent on the capacity of the hdfs
there is a discussion on so small files and hdfs blocks
the provided sql filters out null so all you need to handle is the empty string
this leads to code repetition which can be improved by position alias possible since version 0 11 0
this can lead to thousands of maps when archiving terabytes of data
with saveastable the default location that spark saves to is controlled by the hivemetastore based on the docs
from shell or directly from hive which is much faster for small files because it is running in an already started jvm works for sequence files
i m not a java or hadoop programmer so my way of solving problem could be not the best one but anyway
unable to load native hadoop library for your platform using builtin java classes where applicable i used the libs from the hadoop master server as is a kind of hack one night drinking coffee and i ve written this code for reading fileseq hadoop input files using this cmd for running this code usr lib jvm java 7 openjdk amd64 bin java jar target sequencefile utility 1 3 jar with dependencies jar d test c none i ve just added this chunk of code to file src main java eu scape project tb lsdr seqfileutility sequencefilewriter java just after the line writer sequencefile createwriter fs conf path keyclass valueclass compressiontype get pc getcompressiontype thanks to these sources of info links if using hadoop core instead of mahour then will have to download asm 3 1 jar manually search maven org remotecontent filepath org ow2 util asm asm 3 1 asm 3 1 jar search maven org search ga 1 asm 3 1 the list of avaliable mahout repos repo1 maven org maven2 org apache mahout intro to mahout mahout apache org good resource for learning interfaces and sources of hadoop java classes i used it for writing my own code for reading fileseq http grepcode com file repo1 maven org maven2 com ning metrics action 0 2 7 org apache hadoop io byteswritable java sources of project tb lsdr seqfilecreator that i used for creating my own project fileseq reader www javased com source dir scape tb lsdr seqfilecreator src main java eu scape project tb lsdr seqfileutility processparameters java stackoverflow com questions 5096128 sequence files in hadoop the same example read key value that doesn t work https github com twitter elephant bird blob master core src main java com twitter elephantbird mapreduce input rawsequencefilerecordreader java this one helped me i used reader nextraw the same as in nextkeyvalue and other subs also i ve changed pom xml for native apache hadoop instead of mahout hadoop but probably this is not required because the bugs for read next key value are the same for both so i had to use read nextraw keyraw valueraw instead
therefore you first you need to setup your hadoop cluster manager to collect the logfiles onto the distributed files system so that you can analyse them
it s difficult to find which data or value is causing issue but at least you can find which column is creating this issue
if nodes really don t come back after a disconnect that may be a configuration issue which could well be completely independent from the reason why they disconnect in the first place
i m using spark 1 5 from cdh 5 5 1 and i get the same result using either df write mode append saveastable test or your sql string
you may be getting large number of files based on kafka partitions
now depending on your requirements you can either add coalesce 1 or more to reduce number of files
for the second issues the batches queue up only because you don t have back pressure enabled
your issues is similar to 5703 judging by the stack trace and as stated in that bug the method gettaskattemptcompletioneventsresponse fetched a job by calling verifyandgetjob but it never checked if job was null or not which was the root cause of this issue
in that bug it lists a scenario in which a job history server jhs is queried about a finished job but jhs failed to receive the info for that job
unfortunately there is nothing else here that might help identify what caused the history upload to fail in your case but that appears to be the underlying source of the issue
failed 2 times happens because when you run in yarn cluster mode driver runs in am whose retry is 2 by default
as mentioned in a very similar question here warn reliabledeliverysupervisor association with remote system has failed address is now gated for 5000 ms reason disassociated the problem is likely to be the lack of memory
adding more memory or in that case more nodes should solve the problem
cause this issue occurs when kerberos is enabled and hive server2 enable doas property in hive is set to true
but as i said you seem to be using the embedded cloudera postgres so i don t think it s your case
python issue sometimes due to a reason i can t control some symlinks to python libraries are lost during the install process
this solves my issue in your script py where the path is the directory in which libhdfs3 lives in my case this is where cloudera hosts the lib
i ran into something very similar and while i am not entirely satisfied with the solution because i can t quite explain why it works it does seem to work
note it may be necessary to use repartition instead of coalesce depending on use case
since nobody seems to have the answer for my problem i would like to share the approach we took to make this processing more efficient comments are very welcome
we use a filestream since it allow us to define the file filter to use
each entry in that stream is one of those json lines which is parsed to extract the file path and size
for each folder read a dataframe loading only the targeted parquet files to avoid race conditions with the other job writing the files calculate how many blocks to write using the size field in the json and a target block size coalesce the dataframe to the desired number of partitions and write it back to hdfs execute the ddl refresh table mytable partition partition keys derived from the new folder finally delete the source files what we achieved is limit the ddls by doing one refresh per partition and batch
the solution is quite flexible since we can assign more or less resources to the spark streaming job executors cores memory etc
because the latest fsimage and edit has been lost or corrupted you should try to recovery the metadata bin hadoop namenode recover refer namenode recovery tools for the hadoop distributed file system because the journal is not sync with the namenode you should reinit it bin hdfs namenode initializesharededits because the recovered fsimage has lost the latest data the updated since last backup you should check and delete the corrupted data bin hadoop fsck delete if you do not do fsck the namenode may be stuck in safe mode for too many unresponsive blocks
as i am submitting this from outside of the docker containers that ip will never be routable so what s happening here i submit the job to the cluster
to fix this i initially setup my datanode container to use a specific hostname by adding the following to that container s definition in my docker compose yml since i didn t have dns setup i added the following to my etc hosts file in this case 10 0 2 2 is my localhost outside of the docker network my actual host
i then updated my hadoop config so that the datanode will return a hostname rather than an ip like so the subsequent spark submit worked after this
this is likely only ideal for a non production environment which in my case it is so it works fine
looking around it looks like there are maybe three options that i ve found for solving this problem character reference 1 is an invalid xml character similar so question unicode characters ctrl g or ctrl a as textoutputformat hadoop delimiter the possible solutions as detailed in the link above are you can base64 encode the separator character
this is because the tasktrackers are running your process not you
if a job is in accepted state for long time and not changing to running state it could be due to the following reasons
another reason is there might be other jobs running which occupies the available slot and no room for new jobs check the value of memory total memory used vcores total vcores used in the resource manager webui main page
this error caused by mapreduce reduce shuffle memory limit percent by default to resolve this problem i restrict my reduce s shuffle memory usage hive mapreduce shuffle error solution
the end server wasn t configured appropriately to respond to ipv6 thus the same issue statement was observed
the most probable reason for no resourcemanager daemon would be an error in http port binding
you can easily find the cause of error
i can read the table it returns correct result but with errors
you seem to be create hive table using avro file and hence you get the error
this error was due to the config in the core site xml file
core site xml if this endpoint is unreachable or if spark detects that the file system is the same as the current system the lib files will not be distributed to the other nodes in your cluster causing the errors above
not copying file tmp spark c1a6cdcd d348 4253 8755 5086a8931e75 __ spark libs __ 1391186608525933727 zip this should lead you to the problem as it starts the train reaction that results from the missing files
because manual work always have more chance for error
clojure has something in common with other java scripting methods such as beanshell groovy and ant in that when you run the script if you use the classloading features of the script language when your script launches it de couples itself from the default classloader and then your jvm is running on the custom classloader for the scripting engine
i have no idea what is causing your error but you should keep in mind that if your doing anything at all in your script that would cause a custom classloader to abandon the jvms default classloader then it might explain a few things
you can check what zookeeper sends as hbase master host find zookeeper bin folder this should give you the hbase master ip that answer zookeeper so this ip must be accessible
the problem is that hive attempts to hold a file handle open for each and every partition it writes out which causes out of memory and crashes
hive 13 will sort by partition key so that it only needs to hold one file open at a time
you can t put a windowing function in a where clause because it would create ambiguity if there are compound predicates
i am quite late here still posting it so it might help someone in future
i am a newbie here so it might be wrong but i think you need to add r in the command as below
the problem was the worker nodes were out of disk space caused by storing the data from transferring the jars as well as storing the stdout and stderr files
specific piece of code which causes this is this occurs when the blockmanager tries to choose a target host for storing new block of data and can not find a single host targets length minreplication
this could occur due to one of the following reasons data node instances are not running data node instances are unable to contact the name node data nodes have run out of space hence no new block of data can be allocated to them but in your case error message also contains following information it means there are 4 data nodes running and all the 4 data nodes were considered for placement of data for this operation
you can also refer to the wiki here https wiki apache org hadoop couldonlybereplicatedto which describes the reasons for this error and ways to mitigate it
it s because the hbase documentation has you setup your hdfs settings to point to port 8020 but the hadoop instructions configure hdfs for port 9000
in fact the signature has change suppression it so it would be just
jobconf is a subclass of configuration so there should exist a constructor for that
i prefer a known random number generator as the results can be reproduced ad nauseam by anyone else
this would serve your purpose since you don t care about file content and would be as fast as deleting a file
i ve found an open source library named fat32 lib but since it doesn t resort to native code i don t think it is useful here
myriad has a steep learning curve so you might have to ask the authors of the software for help
explanation this issue is caused by hadoop since it assumes you re running on unix and abides by the file permission rules
we solved it by using a vm virtual box with ubuntu and a shared directory between windows and linux so we can develop and built on windows and run nutch crawling on linux
it s a long time since i haven t used it though

it depends on where your job is failing if a line is corrupt and somewhere in your map method an exception is thrown then you should just be able to wrap the body of your map method with a try catch and just log the error but if the error is thrown by your inputformat s recordreader then you ll need to amend the mappers run method who s default implementation is as follows so you could amend this to try and catch the exception on the context nextkeyvalue call but you have to be careful on just ignoring any errors thrown by the reader an ioexeption for example may not be skippable by just ignoring the error
for your specific case if you just want to ignore a file upon the first failure then you can update the run method to something much simpler some final words of warning you need to make sure that it isn t your mapper code which is causing the exception to be thrown otherwise you ll be ignoring files for the wrong reason gzip compressed files which are not gzip compressed will actually fail in the initialization of the record reader so the above will not catch this type or error you ll need to write your own record reader implementation
the reason in my case it failed is that i set up passwordless ssh between user on the oozie server and user on the remote machine
you ll want at least one spark worker on each cassandra node so that loading data into spark is done locally on each node and not over the network
don t think configuration is a root cause but data model issue
responsible for data distribution across cassandra nodes
encounter start date column would be a clustering key responsible for data sorting inside partition
we were getting exactly the same error stack trace as you so i set it to 5000 which fixed the problem and had no ill effects
from what i can tell the root cause is inputformat implementations that do not properly use try finally to ensure that connections get closed when an exceptions are thrown
to make scan faster do not include any column family in the scan result as all you need is the row key for deleting whole rows
first my understanding of the requirement is there are contents with content id and each content has charts generated against them and those data are stored there can be multiple charts per content via dates and depends on the rank
consequently it would be enough to define java home at hadoop home conf hadoop env sh otherwise when this is not enough the problem may be that the configuration environment used hadoop env sh is not the one we are expecting hadoop is choosing another one or the default value if none found
you should be able to assert this is true by printing out the result of job getjar after you call job setjarbyclass and if it doesn t display a jar filepath then it s found the build class rather than the jar d class
what worked for me was exporting a runnable jar the difference between it and a jar is that the first defines the class which has the main method and selecting the packaging required libraries into jar option choosing the extracting option leads to duplicate errors and it also has to extract the class files from the jars which ultimately in my case resulted in not resolving the class not found exception
that s the reason you have to do hadoop fs ls as you are using hadoop api to read files here
since you aren t setting a remote address on the conf and essentially using the same configuration both hadoopfs and localfs are pointing to an instance of localfilesystem
this value depends on the block size and the cluster wide config bytes per checksum
if it does then you need to amend your mapper code to account for the fact that this file will be available in the local working directory of the mapper at runtime
it should certainly be possible to look at the classes supporting the namespace and hack a working configuration to find how to obtain same result with java config but honestly i think the cost gain ratio does not justify it
by convention it will depend on the hadoopconfiguration bean defined by the java based hadoopconfigconfigurer
you should mention the absolute path of input directory so the format should be hadoop jar jarfilename jar classname input dir outputdir right the following is wrong because it is relative path hadoop jar jarfilename jar classname input dir outputdir wrong
basically this error is due to missing atlas jar in oozie share lib
if anybody face the problem please comment here so that i can help
restart is part of administration and spark has support for checkpointing to hdfs so you would be able to go back to the last time checkpoint was called that hdfs was available
this parameter needs to be set carefully and if not set properly this could lead to bad performance or outofmemory errors
since you have more than one reducer your mappers will write outputs to the local disk on your slaves as opposed to in hdfs
the easiest way i think is to compress your immediate output from mappers using the following two config settings since your data is all json text data i think you will benefit from any compression algorithm supported by hadoop
you need to call the static method org apache hadoop mapreduce counters limits init in the setup method of your mapper or reducer to get the setting to take effect
the para is set by config file while paras below will take effect
note x and y are custom values based on your environment requirement
in case it is string in process function we retrieve it as string as we do with the customerid then parse it to long b i decided to use a udtf instead of udf because this way it generates all the data it needs
so with the udf function deltacomputerudf described in the first edit of the original post the query will be c both functions udf and udtf work as desired no matter the order of rows inside the table so there is no requirement that table data to be sorted by customer id and call time before using delta functions
if you see this error all of a sudden then it might be due to time drifts of virtual machines
your hadoop jobs may initially run successfully because the drift may not be quite noticeable
however on long running clusters if one of the worker time drifted too long when compared to master s time that it exceeds the 10 minute interval then the jobs fail because the yarn containers scheduled on this workers will be marked expired as soon as the am submits it
ntp is responsible for time sync with global time servers and your master worker nodes
some obvious issues that can cause ntp un synchronized your firewall may be blocking udp port 123
due to the way the brew package is laid out you need to point the hadoop prefix to the libexec folder in the package you would then remove the libexec from your declaration of the conf directory
i had the same problem it was because of rights root
this is because hive is not able to contact your namenode check if your hadoop services has started properly
the reason why you get this error is that hive needs hadoop as its base
solved by change my etc hostname formerly it is my user machine name after i changed it to localhost then it went well i guess it is because hadoop may want to resolve your hostname using this etc hostname file but it directed it to your user machine name while the hadoop service is running on localhost
looking at the example on the hadoopstreaming wiki page it seems that you should change to since shipped files go to the working directory
one other sneaky thing can cause this
if your line endings on the script are dos style then your first line the shebang line may look like this to the naked eye but its bytes look like this to the kernel when it tries to execute your script it s looking for an executable called usr bin python r which it can t find so it dies with no such file or directory
this bit me today again so i had to write it down somewhere on so
it s the reason the lie
most likely you re using an older version hence you don t have it yet
the root cause of this is datanode and namenode clusterid different please unify them with namenode clusterid then restart hadoop then it should be resolved
the issue arises because of mismatch of cluster id s of datanode and namenode
the issue arises because of mismatch of cluster id s of datanode and namenode
in this scenario the version file is not available hence appearing as the error above
you shouldn t put mahout jars in the hadoop lib since that sort of installs a program too deeply in hadoop
and when you compile code with mvn package then it will create mia 0 1 job jar in the target directory this archive contains all dependencies except hadoop s so you can run it on hadoop cluster without problems
export hadoop classpath home xxx my jar opt cloudera parcels cdh 4 3 0 1 cdh4 3 0 p0 22 lib mahout mahout core 0 7 cdh4 3 0 jar opt cloudera parcels cdh 4 3 0 1 cdh4 3 0 p0 22 lib mahout mahout core 0 7 cdh4 3 0 job jar opt cloudera parcels cdh 4 3 0 1 cdh4 3 0 p0 22 lib mahout mahout examples 0 7 cdh4 3 0 jar opt cloudera parcels cdh 4 3 0 1 cdh4 3 0 p0 22 lib mahout mahout examples 0 7 cdh4 3 0 job jar opt cloudera parcels cdh 4 3 0 1 cdh4 3 0 p0 22 lib mahout mahout integration 0 7 cdh4 3 0 jar opt cloudera parcels cdh 4 3 0 1 cdh4 3 0 p0 22 lib mahout mahout math 0 7 cdh4 3 0 jar then i was able to run hadoop com mycompany mahout csvtovector iris nb iris1 csv iris nb data iris seq so you have to include all your jars and the mahout jar in the hadoop classpath and then you can just run your class with hadoop classname
since in your case this variable is overridden in hadoop env sh therefore consider using the libjars option instead alternatively invoke fsshell manually
this is because bags are unordered sets of tuples so pig doesn t know what order that the tuples should be set to when it is converted into a tuple
there are a few reasons hadoop can kill tasks by his own decisions a task does not report progress during timeout default is 10 minutes b fairscheduler or capacityscheduler needs the slot for some other pool fairscheduler or queue capacityscheduler
c speculative execution causes results of task not to be needed since it has completed on other place
in my understanding below are definitions for failed vs killed tasks task can be failed because of task throws a runtime exception sudden exit of the child jvm timeout exceeding mapred task timeout task can be killed because of fairscheduler or capacityscheduler needs the slot for some other pool fairscheduler or queue capacityscheduler
speculative execution causes results of task not to be needed since it has completed on other place
because the entire job s steps can be computed before execution time the system can take advantage of caching intermediate job results in memory
better utilization of all available cluster resources generally leads to faster
i think the main two reasons that will make hive to run faster over tez are tez will share data between map reduce jobs in memory when possible avoiding the overhead of writing reading to from hdfs with tez you can run multiple map reduce dags defined on hive in one tez session without needing to start a new application master each time
intermediate results are stored in memory not written to disks
here s an old jira discussing the illegal character https issues apache org jira browse hadoop 3257 note that you probably won t be able use that absolute path either since it still has in the filename
the best way to fix this is to tackle the root cause of rsrc hbase common 0 98 1 hadoop2 jar being introduced using eclipse to build your runnable jar is one likely cause of the issue
in some cases it will not be created automatically so you should create one by yourself following these steps under the menu accessed by clicking your account name from within the aws console you will find a security credentials option
use case in mysql the following is valid this is super useful for scripts that need to repeatedly call this variable since you only need to execute the max date query once rather than every time the variable is called
because the join is a map rather than a broadcast join it should not significantly hurt performance
for example the suggested solution by visakh is not optimal because stores the string select count 1 from table name rather than the returned value and so will not be helpful in cases where you need to call a var repeatedly during a script
it allows to store result or part of it in a variable and use this variable later in your code
with hive the main part is to extract the number from the result
also if you re getting too large a result you can use silent true flag to silent the execution which would reduce the log messages
the problem occurs when tez tries to calculate how many mappers it needs to spawn and while doing this calculation it tends to go oom due to the default 1gb is too less
prior to hive 2 1 0 hive 13248 the return type was a string because no date type existed when the method was created
problem here was that i was doing the following since the job constructor makes an internal copy of the conf instance adding the cache file afterwards doesn t affect things
thanks to harsh on hadoop user list for the help
for some reason it s not compatible with excel or power bi
if you have files with 2 different schemas the following seems to be sensible split up the files based on which schema they have make tables out of them if desirable load the individual tables and store them into a supertable
you can store the time counter and re read the file from hdfs each 10 15 minutes second is to read some file in the transform transformation over the dstream and save the results of it in memory
the issue was due to the missing hadoop conf dir path while launching the spark job so whenever you are submitting the job set hadoop conf dir to appropriate hadoop conf directory
as you can see here yarn resourcemanager address is calculated based on yarn resourcemanager hostname which its default value is set to 0 0 0 0
exucuting start yarn sh again will put your new settings into effect
my cause is that the times are not the same between machines since my resource manager is not on the master machine
just one second difference can cause yarn connection problem
a few more seconds difference can cause your name node and date node unable to start
when you work outside of the framework you basically have to just deal with the consequences
some thoughts and my experiences thus far in doing a similar experiment worked through in a spike during a sprint from my experiences i could be wrong you don t really spin up more bolts as demand increases but rather you adjust the parallelism configurations of each one in the topology
a parallelism of 12 means it will result in 12 threads executing the bolt in parallel across the storm cluster
in that case you would wrap a bolt to do persistence to the datastore for whatever data is needed
in my case the issue was caused by old java version 1 5 which was default on the server
from cloudera on version 0 20 2 but a similar issue probably applies for later versions it s also possible that setting mapred child java opts programmatically is too late you might want to verify it really is going into effect and put it in your mapred site xml if not
as syrza pointed out in the given link the shutdown hooks are likely done in incorrect order when an executor failed which results in this message
i understand you will have to little more investigation to figure out the main cause of problem i e
if it is a large shuffle it might be an out of memory error which cause executor failure which then caused the hadoop filesystem to be closed in their shutdown hook
the next file operation then results in the above exception
you could use a breakpoint in your debugger or modify the hadoop source code to throw an exception in these methods so you would get a stack trace
it can run on the server side yes but this is not a recommended setup for fault tolerance and performance reasons
if you get the eof exception it means that the port is not accessible externally on that ip so there is no data to read between the hadoop client server ipc
since 2 7 0 there is a find but it is very limited according to the documentation step 1 recursive ls step 2 use awk to pick files only and csv files only directories are recognized by their permissions that start with d so we have to exclude those
i am assuming you have any standard awk so i will not use gnu extensions
apart from performance improvements the other major addition is it integrates with zookeeper now so the master isn t a single point of failure anymore
hbase used to fall over with small cell sizes with memory issues because of a limitation of the file format
i can t really comment on what it s like care taking a production cluster because we only just started with a production one
an aspect that helps is the mailing list is extremely active and irc is in constant use so there s a very strong community for helping out at least
just in case somebody else stubles upon this error it seemed like this was caused due to hadoop running out of disc space
i was also facing the similar issue in my case task got completed successfully
therefore you need to remember that you need to be able to split your data between your node machines effectively otherwise you will end up with a horizontally scalable system with all the work still being done on one node albeit better queries depending on the case
at the end of the day it really depends on the level of business resistance and the mission critical nature of your system
another path that no one thus far has mentioned is newsql i e
there are a few out there like mysql cluster i think and voltdb which may suit your cause but again depending on your data are the files word docs or text docs with info about products invoices or instruments or something again it comes to understanding your data and the access patterns nosql systems are also non rel i e
it is storage to processing the data for reports analytics nas is for file sharing san is more for a database http www slideshare net jabramo emc sanoverviewpresentation declaration i am not a emc person so you can consider any product
because of this in the reducer you can sum the values in the iterator
if sum is something like sum k1 k2 k3 you might divide by size after or during summing up so the average is also k1 size k2 size k3 size
0 0 is never null so it ll pick that
as noted in another answer spark can be a little picky about hostname vs ip address because of this resolved bug feature see bug here
you can get a situation where the worker can contact the master but the master can t get back to the worker so it looks like no connection is being made
to ignore hour minute second use from timestamp result 2020 01 01 select from timestamp cast 2020 01 01 01 01 01 000000 as timestamp yyyy mm dd
the same logic worked for me in scala note i also removed the setmaster local because it makes sense that would interfere too
after that you should run following to define findbugs home now your build should not fail due to missing findbugs home environment variable
this is probably because you left sparkconf setmaster local n in the code
according to this bug hive 9481 you can specify column list in insert statement since 1 2 0
note that i noticed a good amount of warnings during the build i suspect some of them to be caused by using the java sdk 1 8 instead of 1 7
i m not 100 sure of the effect of having a win32 component for this win64 build
it shouldn t affect the quality of the build itself but let s keep in mind the result is an unofficial unsupported use at your own risk hadoop intended for a development environment
instead of hadoop jar avro tools jar one can run java jar avro tools jar since you don t need hadoop for this operation
not sure if you re still experiencing this issue but since i ve confronted the same problem and resolved it perhaps bypassed is more accurate description i ll post a solution here just in case someone else needs it
this is because the thrift server is expecting to authenticate via sasl when you open your transport connection
so that we can put our data sources into the hdfs file system while performing the map reduce job e we need to provide aliases to start and stop hadoop daemons
either way hadoop is trying to feed into via stdin to your script but since the application has terminated and thus stdin is no longer a valid file descriptor you re getting a brokenpipe error
i would suggest adding stderr traces in your script to see what line of input is causing the problem
if your executable stops for any reason before streaming sends you 100 of the input streaming says hey where did that executable go that i stood up hmmmm the pipe is broken let me raise that exception
so the trick was to remove resolvconf which is installed by default since ubuntu 10 04 i believe
your exception is due to the missing hadoop common jar which has the org apache hadoop conf configuration
with some hit and trial i have added following dependencies on my pom file and since then i am able to run code on both chd 5 3 1 and 5 2 1 cluster
seems like you are all working with cloudera i found that the repo in maven looks old because if you go to their site you can download their jdbc
thus
it is intended for use with amazon emr but the jar is available in s3 so you might be able to use it outside of an emr job flow
you can get this error code for two main reasons your mapper and reducer scripts are not executable include the usr bin python at the beginning of the script
i got the same error sub process failed with code 1 this is primarily because of a hadoop unable to access your input files or may be you have something in your input which is more than required or something missing
chmod x mapper py and chmod x reducer py run the mapper of reducer python file using cat using only mapper cat join2 gen txt mapper py sort using reducer cat join2 gen txt mapper py sort reducer py the reason for running them using cat is because if your input files have any error you can remove them before you run on hadoop cluster
another reason such as you have an error in your shell script to run the mapper py and reducer py
the hiveql query is therefore
this query gives me perfect result select key product code cost sum cost over partition by key as total costs from zone
default value is itself a small size so its not worth to split it again
i would recommend following configuration before your query you can apply it based upon your input data
how mappers get assigned number of mappers is determined by the number of splits determined by the inputformat used in the mapreduce job
suppose your hdfs block configuration is configured for 64mb default size and you have a files with 100mb size then it will occupy 2 block and then 2 mapper will get assigned based on the blocks but suppose if you have 2 files with 30mb size each file then each file will occupy one block and mapper will get assigend based on that
the size of the combined split is determined by so if you want to have less splits less mapper you need to set this parameter higher
since you have 2 splits each split is read by one mapper
hence there now is not a default constructor
consider the native mapreduce analog assuming your input data set is text based the input mapper s key and hence unique id would be for each line the name of the file plus its byte offset
elaborating on the answer by jtravaglini there are 2 built in hive virtual columns since 0 8 0 that can be used to generate a unique identifier use like this or you can anonymize that with md5 or similar here s a link to md5 udf https gist github com dataminelab 1050002 note the function class name is initcap md5
i needed a pure binary version so i used this unhex regexp replace reflect java util uuid randomuuid
depending on the nature of your jobs and how frequently you plan on running them using sequential numbers may actually be a reasonable alternative
you can implement a rank udf as described in this other so question
there are 2 ways to fix that make sure you added the dependencies on the spark submit command so it s distributed to the whole cluster add the dependencies on the jars directory on your spark home for each worker in the cluster
if you open a parquet file text editor at the very bottom you will see something like parquet mr and that could help you know what version format the file was created from the method above though simple the creator can be something else like impala or other component that can create parquet files and you can use parquet tools https github com apache parquet mr tree master parquet tools since it looks like you are using spark to read the parquet file you might be able to work around it by setting spark sql parquet filterpushdown to false
we have seen this error in other environments and it was caused by spark not having the permission to access the file
since there s a bounty i ll repost this as a reply as well but in reality i would like to flag this as a duplicate since the actual exception is the one covered in another question and answered it is caused by hdp version not getting substituted correctly
i can t give you a precise solution but what i can do is tell you what the root cause can be try to run the sqoop job as a non root user
your job got failed because of one of the above reasons
i suggest you not to use string data type for your created time and timestamp because it makes comparisons harder
and one more suggestion when your created time and your time stamp are not exactly in the same time ticks may be 0 001 seconds difference because of difference insert time if you insert now or sysdate for each of them you better truncate the date to seconds or milli seconds or whatever you think is better
one more thing use nvl or convert null values here as well becuase if you have such problems it is also possible to have null values in your table which causes problems in your queries nvl function will convert null to something you like
i d suggest v16 as that still has the zero args constructor on the stopwatch class see guava 16 of course this solution depends on guava 16 working with the closure compiler
in built tostring will return array of strings thats the reason it is giving address in your output instead of values
i m going to answer this question because it s the important one
when you say users want the most up to date info does up to date mean everything in the past which leads to total serialization of each transaction to the graph so that answers reflect every possible piece of information
or everything transacted more than x seconds ago which leads to partial serialization which multiple database states in the present that are progressively serialized into the past
if 1 is required you may well have unavoidable hot spots in your code depending on the application
you have immediate information for when to roll back a transaction because it of inconsistency
the clients can have their own copy of raw data and then generate calculations visualizations based on what they know and the updates they receive
if for some reason you absolutely have to process data server side and send it to the client for example client is 3rd party software not something you have control over and it expects processed data not raw data then you do have a bit of an issue so get a bad ass server or 3 or 30
since each column family represents a separate store on regionserver accessing multiple stores takes more time
you want to have your main key be the username concatenated with the time stamp since most of your queries are by user
you shouldn t see much of a performance hit from doing this and then you don t have to worry about concurrency since all operations are write only and atomic
i m not sure if i answered everything since your question was so broad
i had been missing one thing that caused the above failure
apparently this error was caused by using the wrong encryption type when issuing the ktutil command
you can find it in org apache hadoop util shell other modules depends on this class and uses it s methods for example getgetpermissioncommand method
either way i decided to track it down for no reason other than to satisfy my ocd ness about these issues
so it seems reasonable to me to assert that the bridge between parquet s jul logging and the slf4j bridge is causing this warning to appear
i d have to dig a bit more into spark s code and test to find out but that s at least what is causing it
i recently upgraded from mr v1 to v2 and in that upgrade all completed jobs are now moved to the history server
aswin alagappan reason is a jar file cotains your path in it
if you re doing idempotent updates redoing these updates shouldn t cause any inconsistencies
as an alternative to robert metzger answer you can write your results again to kafka and then use one of the maintained kafka s connectors to drop the content of a topic inside your mongodb database
the following is a vanilla hive query no dynamodb integration demonstrating the effects of attempting to convert various inputs to a bigint
at just 1 higher the conversion fails resulting in null
perhaps that s a solution depending on your use case
from your stack trace it appears that the dynamodb integration results in a numberformatexception for this case rather than null
i have not used emr but here goes my guess hive automatically try to transform your input because your target field is a bigint did you try something like this
based on my experience this should avoid the casting of your input however you could get exceptions inserting in the new table you can cast your fields during the select if you have too many columns you can also try this https community hortonworks com questions 7703 whether hive supports hive select all query with e html
in vast majority of cases using parameter driver is not required and even more will lead to an undesirable behaviour
this is one of the reasons why it s recommended to not use the driver option at all
i m using hadoop 2 2 0 so i put it inside hadoop home share hadoop common lib directory and use the following command to do the import export hcat home home kuntal big data hive 0 12 0 hcatalog sometimes hcatlog of hive needs to be exported or set
if spark does not points to proper hadoop configuration directory it might results in similar error
because we don t know which node will be a am application master node
i ve managed to get this working to the point where jobs are dispatched tasks executed and results compiled
i have stepped on this mine too and was angry enough to find the reason zookeeper checks jline during zookeepermain run
open source zookeeper 3 4 6 depends on jline 0 9 94 which has no such patches
the virtualbox vm host name does not since there s no entry on the hosting machine that tells it to resolve the hostname and go to localhost in your case and there s nothing that helps resolve it like a dns
i have created application jar using mvn package instead of mvn clean compile assembly single so that it will not download the maven dependencies while creating jar but need to provide these jar dependencies run time which resulted in small size jar as there is only reference of dependencies
then i have added below two parameters in spark defaults conf on each node as so question arises that how application jar will get the maven dependencies required jar s run time
it looks like this is part of a known issue where certain memory settings end up computed based on the master machine s size rather than the worker machines size and we re hoping to fix this in an upcoming release soon
i happen to be reading spark release notes and see this with this linked bug https issues apache org jira browse spark 25004 i ve long since worked around my original issue and then changed jobs so i no longer have the ability to try this out
this could be due to the missing configurations required for the clients to connect with the current active namenode
the reducer output will be a single file having all the output sorted based on the key
hive order by uses a single reducer so you can use distribute by sort by and then from the sorted table you can do insert overwrite local from table to write the data into a file
one side effect is that code compiled against hadoop 1 0 is not compatible with hadoop 2 0 and vice versa
however source code is mostly compatible and thus one just need to recompile code with target hadoop distribution
i think the problem is that your master is listening on 127 0 0 1 9000 so datanode can t connect because it is not listening at 192 168 1 101 9000 theoretically a good place to listen is 0 0 0 0 9000 since avoids this problems but seems this configuration is not accepted
in my case it was outdated maven component dependency on xerces impl 2 4 0 due to mockrunner 1 0 3 used on test phase
like this i believe the cat unable to write output stream is just because head closed the stream after it read its limit
in this case no need of virtualizing it because the vms that you create will consume some resources from the total resources
so if you try to achieve multiple machines in the same parent machine small machines by using virtualization it won t help you because lot of resources will be consumed by the os of individual machines
instead if you install hadoop in the machine and configure the resources properly to hadoop the jobs will execute in multiple containers depending upon the availability and requirement and hence parallel processing will happen
thus you can achieve the maximum performance out of the existing machine
the best way to utilize all the cores is method 1 to use virtualization if the hardware supports install esxi or any of the hypervisors and create the vm instances of linux machines or install openstack cloud and create vms so that you can fully utilize the hardware
its always better to use distributed mode because in pseudo distributed mode there is a chance that data loss in case of crash of the system as the replication factor is 1 whereas in distributed mode the replication factor by default is 3
and as in the pseudo distributed mode each deamon spins up with one java thread even a loss in single thread may cause entire mr job to run again
it s unlikely that a path could even have a file representation that would behave equivalently because the underlying models are fundamentally different
hence the lack of translation
for the reasons above this isn t going to work very well
if it s a third party library then you re out of luck the authors of that method didn t take into account the effects of a distributed filesystem and only wrote that method to work on plain old local files
this gives me solution based on hadoop usergroupinformation class
you don t need to copy anything or change permissions because of previous points
you are getting an error because first column in your mysql table could be varchar and second column is a number
as per below string 16 0 9 2 0 13 23 a1182 a 1 apub x a21782 ait a1 a0 a0 a0 a0 a0 0 a0 0 a0 0 your first column parsed by sqoop is 16 and second column is 9 2 so its better to specify a delimiter in quotes 0x01 or its always easy and has better control use hive create table command as create table tablename row format delimited fields terminated by t as select and specify t as delimiter in your sqoop command
as such it can only fall in the cp side since taking down the namenode takes down the entire hdfs system no availability
hadoop does not try to hide this since the decission where to place data and where it can be read from is always handled by the namenode which maintains a consistent view in memory hdfs is always consistent c
it is also partition tolerant in that it can handle loosing data nodes subject to replication factor and data topology strategies
systems that allows you to modify both the write and the read quorums can be tuned to be either cp or ap depending on the needs
i was able to get this working with the following setting restart of jobtracker service required as well special thanks to jeff on hadoop mailing list for helping me track down problem
your yarn application exits immediately after it starts then sparkcontext is closed so any action on this context will throw the exception you see
check the application master logs visible through yarn s ui to see the cause for the failure
this is due to mismatch in hivesever2 version if hive version is more than 0 13 then you may have to use this
i guess the reason is that the java compiler or jvm doesn t read classpath as supposed
as a result the following achieves the same before copying any file into hdfs just be certain to create the parent directory first
so now we move to our point first reach to your hadoop home directory and from there run this script result will like this so here xuiob78126arif is my name node master user and the namenode user directory is now you can go to your browser and search the address and from there you can get the cluster summary namenode storage etc
note the script will provide results only in one condition if at least any file or directory exist in datanode otherwise you will get so in that case you first put any file by bin hadoop fs put source file full path and there after run the bin hadoop fs ls script
to leave safe mode try below command since hadoop dfsadmin safemode is deprecated in newer distribution of hadoop by default user s home directory in hdfs exists with user hduser not as home hduser
this happens because hive is set to strict mode
one reason hadoop produces this error is when the directory containing the log files becomes too full
another cause can be jvm error when you try to allocate some dedicated space to jvm and it is not present on your machine
a create call has the same round trip but create is a write operation that entails a couple more round trips between the servers in the zk cluster so a create is a little more expensive that an exist
if you want to be really fast you can use the async api so that you can create all the components of your path without waiting for the server to respond to requests 1 by 1
i had the same error hadoop conf dir was defined so i just unset the environment variable
well for anything windows they will all have a space somewhere since program files has a space in it
next there are likely two places where you need to fix the problem in your path conf hadoop env sh script you should be setting the java home script and it should look something like export java home cygdrive c program files java jdk1 7 0 06 note that there are quotation marks around the program files so that it is recognized as a single element
you cannot use the escape character because cygwin does some finagling of windows to unix paths so the cannot act as escape
all the other environment variables that hadoop needs are not dependent upon anything within the program files pathway
so that s why you only see the one error being flagged
libjars makes jars only available for jvms running remote map and reduce task to make these same jar s available to the client jvm the jvm that s created when you run the hadoop jar command need to set hadoop classpath environment variable see http grepalex com 2013 02 25 hadoop libjars another cause of incorrect libjars behaviour could be in wrong implementation and initialization of custom job class
i found the answer it was throwing error cause i was missing on the main class name in the command
note currently on emr there is a limitation that prevents sbin restart from working properly so you must use stop then start instead of restart
therefore set this works for older versions of spark
it must exist since the command line tools see them fine
in my case this error was due to the version of the jars make sure that you are using the same version as in the server
in my case strangely this error was because in my core site xml file i mentioned ip address rather than hostname
setting hive hiveconf hive root logger debug console may not always work because of company specific setup
no code was posted so i cannot provide a more specific solution but there are two ways this error can occur if you are using a library that is still new somewhat untested you might find there is a problem with it in some corner cases more likely however is that you made a mistake in your code
if you don t have the flexibility to change what you send then you may be able to use org apache flume source http blobhandler depending upon what processing you are trying to do nb
update 2 you are not supposed to proceed in that direction
the reason is that still other applications might throw out the same exception which is again trouble
in practice it typically means that the process is performing disk access in this case i d guess one of the following hdfs is performing a lot of disk accesses and it s making other disk access slow as a result
can you imagine the list of bugs that have been fixed since 0 98
regarding the correspondence between the data yielded by the mapper and the data sets to be combined in the reducer if the data sets for each key are not too big you can simply yield from the mapper a combination like thus you will be able to group the values with same origin in the reducer into dictionaries which will be the data sets over which the cartesian product will be applied using itertools product
caused by org apache hadoop hbase masternotrunningexception the node hbase is not in zookeeper
since i was using hbase as a standalone i didnt had to run zookeeper infact it gave an error when i did so the complete hbase site xml configuration file looks like
running will classify a text file based on the model
ok digging a bit into spark and thanks to someone guiding me on the spark user list i think i got it and the emptiabletextinputformat which does the magic one could eventually check the message of the invalidinputexception for a lil more precision
thus try setting up higher am map and reducer memory when a large yarn job is invoked
the jobs are killed as far as i understand due to no memory issues
although the place in the logs where it gives the reason why the job was killed still eludes me
rest delivers as either xml or json so that the schema is present in the data itself
thrift doesn t do this it is just a load of bytes that then can only be deserialized against a generated entity based on the thrift idl definition
so regardless of how the data is compressed thrift is bound to be faster as it carries no schema with it at the cost of being dependent on other objects to interpret the binary data
the coalesce function is only used to reduce the number of partitions so you should consider using the repartition function
dynamic partitions are created based on number of blocks on filesystem hence the task overhead of scheduling so many tasks mostly kills the performance
both of the above commands use amazon s s3 as source you have to specify the artifact name accordingly
based on your application you need to check if enabling combiner helps or not
if working with two or more simultaneous jobs however it should be transparent to the user in that spark or whatever resource manager would manage how the resources are managed depending on the user settings
i mention these above because i am not sure what do you mean by saying 4 slaves per node by default spark would start exact 1 worker on each slave unless you specify spark worker instances n in conf spark env sh where n is the number of worker instance you would like to start on each slave
we had this problem too when we were writing to an nfs mount because all nodes would share the same history userlogs directory
if you are already logging locally and still manage to process 30 000 tasks on one machine in less than a week then you are probably creating too many small files causing too many mappers to spawn for each job
setting yarn nodemanager log dirs to file dev null is not possible because a directory is needed
if you access the hive logs and find the exception call stack you can find the root cause or if you share the exception i might be able to help you
this is only because after some time wait time expired and disconnect happen
port specific errors be sure to setup an open port for your hive server and set it as below before starting hive server there could be other reasons however your best option is to check the call stack in hive logs to root cause and solve the problem
but based on those requirements answers are yes listed above no imho renaming a file is good choice for the job
thus you cannot add an intwritable to an int which is what you do if you remove the get method
these interfaces are all necessary for mapreduce the comparable interface is used for comparing when the reducer sorts the keys and writable can write the result to the local disk
it does not use the java serializable because java serializable is too big or too heavy for hadoop writable can serializable the hadoop object in a very light way
use your package manager to search for openjdk and then look for a package in the result list which says jdk
spark is discouraging the usage of directfileoutputcommitter as it might lead to data loss in case of race situation
mapreduce can be a complex topic so i found it easier to understand it by applying its approach to a simple problem
location of log files will depend on that
it usually sits usr local hadoop store hdfs that is a common reason
the issue isn t actually a syntax error the hive parseexception is just caused by a reserved keyword in hive in this case end
the problem because i just wanted to run spark in local mode i found a solution to solve this problem
the above core site xml doesn t seem to have space so the issue may be different from what i had
user3591785 pointed me in the correct direction so i marked his answer as correct
the result was a map with one element
the file name as key and the content as the value so i needed to transform this into a javapairrdd
i am not responsible for the setup
in the time since the answer was posted hadoop 3 has come out
based on this page even the distribution of microsoft no longer is available on windows
though testing is a different matter the consequence is that the testing for windows is not likely to receive much love and a workaround remains required
i think daterange from can be dynamically generated from current date function by adding and subtracting the days based on your requirement
this error generally occurs due to the mismatch in your binary files in your hadoop home bin folder
i have been having issues with my windows 10 hadoop installation since morning where the namenode and datanode were not starting due the mismatch in the binary files
however due to branch predictors i assume this overhead will not be that dramatic
since state of object is maintained as instance variables static method mostly operates on arguments almost all static method accepts arguments perform some calculation and return value
you cannot do that because if you can imagine ever requiring to use object inheritance or needing to use polymorphism for your method you should definitely skip the static and make it an instance method
the memory overhead limit exceeding issue i think is due to directmemory buffers used during fetch
spark even generates random keys in repartition so it is not done with a hash that could be biased
i tried your example and get the exact same results with spark 1 6 2 and spark 2 0 0
since complexity is exponential it s going to take a very long time for anything other than trivial examples
this has been generalised since to the multiple travelling saleman problem see for example this paper opensource for some nice work into it http www researchgate net publication 263389346 multi type ant colony system for solving the multiple traveling salesman problem in an interview situation i would detail it has the pros as 1 being an efficient heuristic solution 2
i infer from google results etc that the answer right now is no there are no other default reducers in hadoop which kind of sucks because it would be obviously useful to have default reducers like say average or median so you don t have to write your own
the reducer output will therefore be the reducers and combiners in this package are very fast compared to running streaming combiners and reducers so using the aggregate package is both convenient and fast
i also faced the same exception as you initially posted and i solved the problem thanks to your comments set dfs replication to 1
in that case isn t it possible to append to a file
most tasks don t encounter this situation since they report progress implicitly by reading input and writing output
simulations are a good example since they do a lot of cpu intensive processing in each map and typically only write the result at the end of the computation
seems like you need to refer to the package name in the relocation rule not the maven groupid i m using rx v1 in my lib and don t want to pollute the user s namespace with it the pom xml section below rewrites the bytecode so the final uberjar will have rx but renamed shaded rx
and that it points the first line of your query most definitely this is because of a forgotten semicolon for a previous query
since parser looks for semicolon as a terminator for each query
since it breaks data lineage spark is not able to detect that you are reading and overwriting in the same table
a reason why this happening is because hive table has following spark tblproperties in its definition
this problem will solve for insertinto method if you remove following spark tblproperties https querydb blogspot com 2019 07 read from hive table and write back to html when we upgraded our hdp to 2 6 3 the spark was updated from 2 2 to 2 3 which resulted in below error this error occurs for job where in we are reading and writing to same path
the problem was actually that for some reason
setting the scanner caching higher will improve scanning performance most of the time but setting it too high can have adverse effects as well each call to next will take longer as more data is fetched and needs to be transported to the client and once you exceed the maximum heap the client process has available it may terminate with an outofmemoryexception
when the time taken to transfer the rows to the client or to process the data on the client exceeds the configured scanner lease threshold you will end up receiving a lease expired error in the form of a scannertimeoutexception being thrown so it would be better not to avoid the exception by the above configuration but to set the caching of your map side lower enabling your mappers to process the required load into the pre specified time interval
larger caching value can cause scannertimeoutexception as your program may take more time in consuming processing fetched rows than timeout value
but it can slowdown you task also as scanner is making more fetch requests to the server so you should fine tune your caching and timeout values as per your program needs
this is important for client configuration as well so your local configuration file should include this element
this might be because of separating the resource allocation and job administration in 2 x architecture
have to wait for completing each flow depends on other class so need job waitforcompletion true but it must to set input and output path before starting mapper combiner and reducer class
otherwise 1 missing block can lead to system to hang in safemode
this has been done for hadoop2 5 in which hadoop namenode format has beendeprecated hence using hdfs namenode format
check hdfs site xml configuration it may has a wrong path for properties dfs namenode name dir and dfs datanode data dir in my case it was the cause of the problem directory was situated in other then current user s home folder
sudo is broken in this situation but pkexec the command line frontend to policykit still works so you can fix it with a single command
to check your hdfs port use the following command in linux you will get the output something like and correct your url accordingly
make sure that your tcp port of nn is on 50075 which is defined in hdfs site xml my problem is that i use http address port to connect with nn this cause the same exception as you
this error arise because of it is not able to contact with namenode namenode might be not running you can check it by running jps command
kill what ever is running in that particular port check what is running in particular port by netstat tulpn grep 8080 and kill 9 pid restart the namenode
leaving the additional steps here for everyone s benefit apt get install autoconf in response to the error autogen sh autoreconf not found for command autogen sh apt get install libtool in response to the error autoreconf libtoolize is needed because this package uses libtool for command autogen sh apt install g in response to the error configure error c preprocessor lib cpp fails sanity check for command configure prefix usr
i currently don t have enough reputation to comment so i add a answer here to update the top voted answer
since protobuf move to different repo the new wget command should be and in order to run autogen sh you may need install these for osx prerequisites try sunitakoppar s answer i don t know why the down votes
the reason for this error is hive not able to find the spark assembly jar
finally after my research it was found that because hive could not load spark jars so i made the following changes to hive env sh
meanwhile since fork join is clearly a big deal it evolves further with jep 155
i m not sure what will happen with java 8 since it is too early to tell but there are a couple of open source projects that extend the map reduce capabilities of earlier functional programming languages that run in the jvm to distributed computing environments
the reason that your job is stuck is that it is unable to find start a container
so your map reduce execution request probably didn t find any mappers in which to run because the request was being sent to the master and the master didn t know about the slave slots
as you are probably already suspecting this is going to be inherently difficult to do because of the runtime requirement for matlab
to see where the stdin stdout fits in so that you can use it with hadoop you can try this or in other words cat the file al oct pipe its output to the executable script al oct and then pipe the output of al oct to the sort utility this is just an example we could have cat any file but since we know that al oct is a simple text file we just use this
from my experience this code is about a factor 2 3 slower than hand coded opencv strongly depends on your algorithm and cpu
set also spark master ip in conf spark env sh to hostname f so that cluster workers can reach the master
it looks like it is based upon and may even be implemented by the replaceall method from the matcher class
it s made for processing streaming data
as you know the main issues with hadoop for usage in stream mining are the fact that first it uses hfds which is a disk and disk operations bring latency that will result in missing data in stream
this problem is due to latest java upgrades please configure it with java 8 its working swiftly
hence there will be no parallelism
i had the same problem because the piece of code you are using it s not working for partition
driver memory 6 fetch size 2 3 4 and 5 options are depends on you cluster configurations you can monitor your spark job on spark ui
sqoop and spark sql both use jdbc connectivity to fetch the data from rdbms engines but sqoop has an edge here since it is specifically made to migrate the data between rdbms and hdfs
you have a bug in your reducer the value iterator re uses the same intwritable throughout the loop so you should wrap the value being added to the list as follows this isn t actually a problem as you re using an array list and your mapper only outputs a single value one but is something that may trip you up if you ever extend this code
you also need to define in your job that your map and reducer output types are different you might want to explicitly define the number of reducers which may be why you never see your sysouts being written to the task logs especially if your cluster admin has defined the default number to be 0 your using the default text output format which calls tostring on the output key and value pairs myarraywritable doesn t have an overridden tostring method so you should put one in your myarraywritable finally remove the overridden write method from myarraywritable this is not a valid implementation compatible with the complimentary readfields method
since you already know the full schema of the target table try creating it first and the populating it with a load data command note the set command is needed since you are performing a full dynamic partition insert
this is caused by guava x y z jar because it is missing make sure that you added it
i have had this error too when trying to use mrunit and the maven dependency was not found so i tried to add it manually
the cause of mrunit not being found was that i was not using the necessary classifier in the dependecy declaration the solution is adding the classifier hadoop1 or hadoop2
the reason was inside build gradle it was being loaded as compileonly
mario so one of the reasons why a region gets stuck in transition is because when it is being moved across regionservers it is unassigned from the source regionserver but is never assigned to another regionserver
if there is no such file for the region in transition it should be under hbase data then hbase thinks there should be a valid hfile for that region in that directory and won t be able to fix it with normal repair commands
none of the repair options worked because all options require that all regions are assigned
hdfs hdfs dfs rm r hbase data default table region after removing the region all repair options worked but the region was reported still in transition due to zookeeper cache
these steps fixed my issue for my single server install edit the etc hosts change the ip address associated with the hostname so that it uses your lan ip instead of 127 0 0 1 open hbase dir conf hbase env sh edit hbase opts append djava net preferipv4stack true
the trick with a subinterface worked for me but i used the loopback interface rather than eth0 because eth0 is not always available on my machine external adapter and i want it managed by networkmanager which refuses to manage eth0 if eth0 1 is defined in etc network interfaces on ubuntu 13 04 relevant snippet in addition to the regular of course
here s another work around that works for me if you re unwilling to alter etc hosts since ubuntu put that entry there for a reason
the resulting mismatch causes the master to think a region server has one ip 127 0 0 1 when it s really listening on another 127 0 1 1 the ip bound to the host s declared fqdn
edit bcolyn s use of lo 0 also works for me and is superior since loopback will always be available
in that case the pre up line also appears unnecessary
the following error is due to missing winutils binary in the classpath while running spark application
args 1 is the name of the input folder you are specifying which is mapped into the output folder by the program and hence you are seeing the exception
this is to prevent overwriting previous results
the input to the mapper depends on what inputformat is used
the inputformat is responsible for reading the incoming data and shaping it into whatever format the mapper expects the default inputformat is textinputformat which extends fileinputformat longwritable text
if you do not change the inputformat using a mapper with different key value type signature than longwritable text will cause this error
one of the reason could be that default native library in hadoop is built for 32 bit
i think that the only problem here is the same as in this question so the solution is also the same stop jvm from printing the stack guard warning to stdout stderr because this is what breaks the hdfs starting script
this error is mostly happen due to mis configuration of bashrc
in linux change the installation path accordingly only this part will change
i guess that you have multiple reducers and your similar results were processed by different reducers for they are in different partitions
i use most of the times hdfs fuse mounts for this so you could just do http www cloudera com content www en us documentation archive cdh 4 x 4 7 1 cdh4 installation guide cdh4ig topic 28 html edit 1 30 16 in case if you use hdfs acls in some cases fuse mounts don t adhere to hdfs acls so you ll be able to do file operations that are permitted by basic unix access privileges
if your job is failing because of outofmemmory on nodes you can tweek your number of max maps and reducers and the jvm opts for each so that will never happen
mapred child java opts the default is 200xmx usually has to be increased based on your data nodes specific hardware
to calculate this it is based on cpu cores and the amount of ram you have and also the jvm max you setup in mapred child java opts the default is 200
that will avoid doing a fulltable scan and results should be fairly quick
i m going to answer my own question because eventually none of the answers didn t seem to solve my problem
i haven t checked in detail but this may have been the cause of this permission problem
try running the job as yarn client mode so the driver runs in the client machine
you could insert values like the column names are totally up to you and there s no limit to how many you can have within reason see the hbase reference guide for more on this
this is simply because hiveserver2 failed to start the error does not show up in console but in hive logs
in my case hive logs are located in tmp ubuntu hive log there might be different reason for you to cause hive server2 failed to start but it definitely worth to look into this log file
try with verbose option so you can see more details
cloudera doesn t officially support apache phoenix it s still in cloudera labs so you cannot find any cloudera pheonix tar gz files in cloudera repository the only place where you can find phoenix in cloudera repository is in the parcel repository however parcel can be used only if you install through cloudera manager latest available version of cloudera phoenix is 4 3 0
due to some dependency issues phoenix pig is not handled this is just a workaround
this problem is occuring due to your hbase server s hosts file
for example your hbase server s etc hosts files seems like this you have to change it like this by removing localhost this is because when remote machine asks hbase server machine where hmaster is running it tells that it is running on localhost
leave it with the default entry localhost because i don t think in standalone mode it really cares and i tried to put server hostname in it and of course this does not works
as a bonus i give you my sbt configuration and some complete working code for the client since the hbase team seems to have spent the documentation budget at vegas for the last 4 years again welcome the business ready world of java scala
in my case those bytes contain utf8 encoded json but of course it depends on how you initially created your eventdata instances that you published to the event hub if someone can post a statically typed solution i ll upvote it but given that the bigger latency in any system will almost certainly be the connection to the event hub archive blobs i wouldn t worry about parsing performance
i was stuck for a while because the capture feature of the azure event hubs sometimes outputs a file without any message content
you only need to run sbin start dfs sh for running hbase since the value of hbase rootdir is set to hdfs 127 0 0 1 9000 hbase in your hbase site xml
the output from hbase shell is quite high level that many misconfiguration would cause this message
to help yourself debug it would be much better to look into the hbase log in to figure out the root cause of the issue
for me my root cause was due to hadoop kms having a conflicting port number with my hbase master
both of them are using port 16000 so my hmaster didn t even get started when i invoke hbase shell
strongly suggest looking into var log hbase to find the root cause
terminal restart is required to make immediate effect of path variable set inside bashrc file
the error is due to missing hadoop hdfs jar files in the hadoop classpath
either that hadoop figures you don t care about them anymore because you wouldn t have left them in a tmp directory if you did and you wouldn t be restarting your machine in the middle of a map reduce job
so based on this site http wiki datameer com display das11 hadoop configuration file templates i edited my conf hdfs site xml file to point to the following paths obviously make your own directories as you see fit did this formatted the new namenode sadly data loss seems inevitable in this situation stopped and started hadoop with the shell scripts restarted the machine and my files were still there ymmv hope this works for you
i m on os x but i don t think you should have dissimilar results
i am not deleting my question and putting the answer here this was done based on advice of this read https code google com p pyodbc issues detail id 162 thanks to the advice from kyle porter below it totally makes sense now
also i believe hadoop itself will at some point close the filesystem so to be safe you should probably only be accessing it from within the reducer s setup reduce or cleanup methods or configure reduce and close depending on which api you re using
hadoop version 2 6 0 cdh5 4 2 running mr1 jobs jython version 2 7 0 only has this problem in the launching phase that is when the main or tool code is running jython s sys prefix is null and sys path doesn t contain the path to jarfile jar lib entry that you need resulting in the error message
if you first look at pathtojar you might think it s not going to work because when you run it in hadoop you actually get the path to the exploded jar in a temporary directory rather than the original jar file
finally i m also assuming that your original job jar is a jar with dependencies that depends on jython standalone and excludes hadoop core as is normally the case for hadoop job jars
generally speaking you can use hbase with mahout by virtue of the fact that mahout uses hadoop mostly and hadoop can use hbase
it s because some subfolders spark or some of its dependencies was able to create yet not all of them
therefore i ran spark pyspark in my case as an administrator which solved the case
since there was no problem with permissions i created the dir that spark was failing to create i e
when i had problems processing large amounts of data it usually was a result of not properly balancing the number of cores per executor
then you can keep reducing it until it hits the same error so that you know the optimum driver memory to use for your job
i have similar problem key error info exitcode 104 physical memory limit increase both spark executor memory and spark executor memoryoverhead didn t take effect

i realized that it can save your time by 3 5 seconds this time also depends on the number of nodes in the cluster
if you re using mac os to run some tasks in standalone mode just remember to enable the remote ssh connection in your system preference sharing i don t know the reason why we should do that before enabling it it takes me about 1 minute to run spark submit xx py after enabling it it only takes me 3 seconds to run it
the accepted answer here might work but only as a side effect
removing the localhost entry in etc hosts forces hbase to bind to the external interface but only because it can t find localhost
it s likely you ll be able to connect via localhost because that s where hbase is bound and not to the ip
the reason being each map reduce task run in ist own jvm and when you don t hadoop in local mode eclipse won t be able to debug
thus running hadoop fs ls will not be a hdfs command but more of hadoop fs ls file a path to your local directory
since i include hadoop jars in my mvn spec i have all hadoop per se in my class path and i have no need to run it against my installed hadoop
depending on what was entered for other properties this was causing various errors like retrying connect connection refused or resource allocation errors
this is unequivocally due to insufficient resources to have the job launched
then you have 2 applications to run so you can give every application 4 cores to run the job
there are also some causes of this same error message other than those posted here
there are no available cores for the job to execute and that s the reason the job s state is still in waiting
i had my logger set improperly was causing the error fixed it the solution might not at all be in changing the paths
http spark apache org docs latest running on yarn html depending upon which hadoop features you are using in your spark application some of the config files will be used to lookup configuration
it is apparently caused by class com sun security auth module unixloginmodule which uses a native call to get the unix username
to instruct hadoop to bypass the lookup of the os username i was able to add the following line of code before all initialization in your case you are running the server so your options of injecting the code are limited
invoke hadoop daemon sh stop tasktracker hadoop daemon sh stop datanode hadoop daemon sh start datanode hadoop daemon sh start tasktracker i m not sure if restarting the tasktracker is required for the changes in mapred site xml to take effect
please leave a comment so that i can correct my answer if needed
so that at the time of running hadoop command it should know where to look specified for main class
has a patch been applied somewhere that added the formerly missing ul end tag which is now redundant since the end tag has been added to the original source
an extra end tag will cause javadoc to fail with this error
the patch for hadoop 10320 was transplanted to the 2 4 1 branch but the new javadocs from hadoop 8059 were not transplanted resulting in malformed markup
removed the file from the hdfs site xml file wrong hdfs site xml correct hdfs site xml thanks to erik for the help
i recently wrote a guide of my own as i also found the official documentation lacking and because all other guides seem to be stuck on the pre yarn hadoop mentality and are full of no longer necessary steps environment values
there s no extra privileges but your command line options get run via the genericoptionsparser which will allow you extract certain configuration properties and configure a configuration object from it http hadoop apache org common docs r0 20 2 api org apache hadoop util genericoptionsparser html basically rather that parsing some options yourself using the index of the argument in the list you can explicitly configure configuration properties from the command line becomes much more condensed with toolrunner one final word of warning though when using the configuration method getconf create your job object first then pull its configuration out the job constructor makes a copy of the configruation object passed in so if you makes changes to the reference passed in you job will not see those changes
a better solution is to fix the hadoop config sh so it picks up your java home correctly in hadoop home libexec hadoop config sh look for the if condition below attempt to set java home if it is not set remove extra parentheses in the export java home lines as below
the following sequence helped to resolve the issue in hadoop 2 7 3 on macos 10 5 17 catalina find out the path where java is installed by running usr libexec java home sample path library java javavirtualmachines adoptopenjdk 8 jdk contents home add java installation path as value of java home environment variable in hadoop installation folder etc hadoop hadoop env sh like below export java home library java javavirtualmachines adoptopenjdk 8 jdk contents home restart yarn processes hadoop installation folder sbin stop yarn sh hadoop installation folder sbin start yarn sh rerun failed map reduce application
i faced similar problem so i used impala to insert the single row into my table and it worked for the same query
but here password less authentication is not configured so each time you try to ssh it will ask you for your password which is a problem if machines try to communicate with each other using ssh
if you have done everything right and have already added keys in authorized keys as well then all you need to do is to remove your id rsa and id rsa pub whatever names you have used for the keypair file and empty your authorized keys in short just take a rollback because you might have given a password while generating rsa key
so just do one thing create again the rsa key by give the name of the file when prompted your filename and then do not give it a passphrase and rather just simply hit enter i e leave it blank and thus you will never see the permission denied error it worked in my case
it does seem ugly but this is a one off hack so beauty and correctness can take a back seat
intermediate serialization seems risky there was a reason you are using kryo and that reason will be negated by using a different intermediate form
this probably will cause problems as part of the serialization or deserialization might be performed by the wrong version of kryo if the reference is used to instantiate any kryo objects and store the reference in the domain model class or instance members then kryo will actually be serializing part of itself in the model
you will have to be careful that your domain object is loaded in the same class loader as your glue code and the code to serialize deserialize depends on the same class loader as your glue code so that they both see the same domain object class
so you send the binary data to the secondary java application simple local sockets would do the trick nicely so you do not have to fiddle with classloaders or packages
edit 2010 08 13 actually this is still happening and it is caused by formatting
i got the following error incompatible namespaceids in home hadoop data dn i have four data nodes in the cluster after starting start dfs sh only one datanode used to come up so the solution was to stop service in nn and jt and remove dn configuration drom hdfs site in all datanodes remove the dn file home hadoop data dn and format the namenode
last login mon jan 4 14 31 05 2016 from localhost localdomain hduser localhost jps 18531 jps hduser localhost start all sh all daemons start note sometime due to logs files other problem occur in that case remove only dot out out files from usr local hadoop logs
for our single node setup of hadoop we therefore need to configure ssh access to localhost
other user s wont be affected due to this unless both are having classes with same package structure
don t put after the testdata user because path hive will take all sub directories automatically
history server runs default in localhost so you need to add your configured host
this problem was due to the history server was not running
possible reasons also make sure you have ip hostname of the machine listed in your hosts file
had the same problem with 2 6 0 and shamouda s answer solved it i was not using dfs hosts at all so that could not be the answer
i couldn t list the ip host mapping in etc hosts because i use dhcp for setting the ips dynamically
you haven t specified your map output types so it s taking the same as you set for your reducer which are text and nullwritable which is incorrect for your mapper
takesample will generally be very slow because it calls count on the rdd
it needs to do this because otherwise it wouldn t take evenly from each partition basically it uses the count along with the sample size you asked for to compute the fraction and calls sample internally
sample is fast because it just uses a random boolean generator that returns true fraction percent of the time and thus doesn t need to call count
since you should have some idea of the size of your data i would recommend calling sample and then cutting the sample down to size yourself since you know more about your data than spark does
since return 0 if exists then
i had the same problem and it was because the workers could not communicate with the driver
solution to your answer reason spark master doesn t have any resources allocated to execute the job like worker node or slave node
fix you have to start the slave node by connecting with the master node like this spark home sbin start slave sh spark localhost 7077 if your master in your local node conclusion start your master node and also slave node during spark submit so that you will get the enough resources allocated to execute the job
sometime java is not able to resolve local addresses for reasons i don t understand
since you re running the docker machine inside a vm you need to open the port on virtualbox
i have encountered the same issue here and resolved now based on the comments and posts above
in my case this is caused by limited resources allocated with default docker vm settings
based on the original post try docker run privileged true hostname quickstart cloudera p 7180 7180 p 8888 8888 t i 9f3ab06c7554 usr bin docker quickstart should solve this problem
right now i m ignoring it because it returns the results before the error happens
i found some old issues in spark jira but didn t found any fixes
one bad solution is to give the temp folder in yout case c users 415387 appdata local temp permission to everyone so it will be like that but i strongly recomend you to not do that
my hadoop environment on windows 10 spark and scala versions below is my spark submit command based on my hadoop environment on windows 10 i defined the following system properties in my scala main class result i am getting the same error but my outputs are getting generated in the output path d hdfs output passed in spark submit hope this helps to bypass this error and get the expected result for spark running locally on windows
similarly update log4j properties in your spark setup like did above with the below lines log4j logger org apache spark util shutdownhookmanager off log4j logger org apache spark sparkenv error now shutdownhookmanager will not be used during exit causing those error lines on console
but the shuffle phase is competing for the same heapspace the conflict which arose caused my jobs to crash
that book provides an alternate definition of the parameter mapred job shuffle input buffer percent since you observed that decreasing the value of mapred job shuffle input buffer percent from it s default of 0 7 to 0 2 solved your problem it is pretty safe to say that you could have also solved your problem by increasing the value of the reducer s heap size

following up on my comment the javadocs for taggedinputsplit confirms that you are probably wrongly casting the input split to a filesplit my guess is your setup method looks something like this unfortunately taggedinputsplit is not public visible so you can t easily do an instanceof style check followed by a cast and then call to taggedinputsplit getinputsplit to get the actual underlying filesplit
so either you ll need to update the source yourself and re compile deploy post a jira ticket to ask this to be fixed in future version if it already hasn t been actioned in 2 or perform some nasty nasty reflection hackery to get to the underlying inputsplit this is completely untested reflection hackery explained with taggedinputsplit being declared protected scope it s not visible to classes outside the org apache hadoop mapreduce lib input package and therefore you cannot reference that class in your setup method
to get around this we perform a number of reflection based operations inspecting the class name we can test for the type taggedinputsplit using it s fully qualified name splitclass getname equals org apache hadoop mapreduce lib input taggedinputsplit we know we want to call the taggedinputsplit getinputsplit method to recover the wrapped input split so we utilize the class getmethod reflection method to acquire a reference to the method method getinputsplitmethod splitclass getdeclaredmethod getinputsplit the class still isn t public visible so we use the setaccessible method to override this stopping the security manager from throwing an exception getinputsplitmethod setaccessible true finally we invoke the method on the reference to the input split and cast the result to a filesplit optimistically hoping its a instance of this type
since spark submit is launched from a different directory it is creating a new metastore db in that directory which does not contain information about your previous tables
using hadoop 2 5 0 cdh5 2 0 this worked for me to change the heap size of the local sequential java process the reason it worked is that usr lib hadoop libexec hadoop config sh has
if you add property on mapred site xml sometimes it happens another because it more than virtual memory limit in this situation you must add on yarn site xml because its default 2 1g sometimes too small
sasl the python package depends on libsasl2 dev on a debian ubuntu machine
edit based on your comment here s a robust way of getting this to work
from infoq post however i have not worked with it yet so i really cannot say much about it in practice
essentially try to do everything that does not depend on the last second data
if you can do that you can really scale because each node can run completely independently of all others
it all depends on your real application
see the discussion about this here how are containers created based on vcores and memory in mapreduce2
my hosts file looked like this on master node for example i changed it like below so it worked
these lines in the yarn site xml solved my problem since the node will be marked as unhealthy when disk usage is 95
for me there was a error in log that s because i switched wifi network in my work place so my computer ip changed
old question but i got on the same issue recently and in my case it was due to manually setting the master to local in the code
first create a table in such a way so that you don t have partition column in the table
you are not getting syntax error because the syntax of the command is correct and used to alter the partition column
the smallest time unit available in the api is minutes so you will not be able to get raw data with timestamps for example
exporting data from bigquery is free of charge but storage and query processing is priced based on usage
since we re supposed to answer the original question there is no way to get actual raw google analytics logs other than by duplicating the server call system
this will give you the ability to join each query result
this is how we do it at scitylana this script below hooks into ga s tracking script and makes sure each hit contains a key for later stitching of query results of course now you need to make some script that joins all the results you have taken out of ga
it can mean a lot of things for us we get the similar error message because of unsupported java class version and we fixed the problem by deleting the referenced java class in our project
they aren t really backed by a collection so it s nontrivial to allow multiple iterations
the situation is caused by the memory optimization of the mapreduce in the reduce method the iterable reuse the item instance for more detail can find here
this gives me excellent transfer performance since multiple files are read written at the same time
since hive currently does not support in exists subqueries you can rewrite your queries using left semi join
i m using hive version 0 7 1 and select from mytable where mycolumn in thisthing thatthing i tested this on a column type string so i am not sure if this works universally on all data types since i noticed like wawrzyniec mentioned above that the hive language manual says that it is not supported and to instead use left semi join but it worked fine in my test
hive supports perfectly the in it does not support the subquery in the where clause there is an open feature ticket from facebook engineers since 4 years https issues apache org jira browse hive 784 focusedcommentid 13579059
hive does support in exists statements since hive 0 13 with few limitations
i m on a university system that s paid for the subscription so i never know what i only have access to because they ve already paid
that ll give you the number of triangles because the i j entry of a k counts the number of length k walks from i to j and since we are only looking at length 3 walks any walk that starts at i and ends at i after 3 steps is a triangle overcounting by a factor of 6
this is mainly less efficient because the size of the matrix will be very large compared to the size of an edgelist if your graph is sparse
i solved this question with the following because in my hadoop etc hadoop hadoop 2 7 3 configuration catalog about mapred site xml in this file
i fixed the issue it was due to incorrect paths
because this error is caused by wrong permission issues in most cases
in my case the problem was due to insufficient memory
bzip2 is splittable in hadoop it provides very good compression ratio but from cpu time and performances is not providing optimal results as compression is very cpu consuming
you can start the reducer tasks while the map tasks are still running using a feature known as slowstart but the reducers can only run the copy phase acquiring the completed results from the completed map tasks
default hashpartitioner has to implement this function this function is responsible for returning you the partition number and you get the number of reducers you fixed when starting the job from the numreducetasks variable as seen for in the hashpartitioner
based on what integer the above function return hadoop selects node where the reduce task for a particular key should run
problem facing below issue while querying the data in impyla data written by spark job root cause this issue is caused because of different parquet conventions used in hive and spark
as per the standard parquet representation based on the precision of the column datatype the underlying representation changes
eg decimal can be used to annotate the following types int32 for 1 precision 9 int64 for 1 precision 18 precision 10 will produce a warning hence this issue happens only with the usage of datatypes which have different representations in the different parquet conventions
if the datatype is decimal 10 3 both the conventions represent it as int32 hence we won t face an issue
this is determined by the property spark sql parquet writelegacyformat the default value is false
in my case i thus interpret the error as spark attempting to read data from a certain non nullable type and stumbling across an unexpected null value
now the fact that the question happens at 0 in block 1 is suspicious it actually almost looks as if the data was not found since block 1 looks like spark has not even started reading anything just a guess
i ran into this issue because i was using hive s decimal datatype and parquet from spark doesn t play nice with decimal
note if you want to format your namenode first stop all hadoop services then delete the tmp contains namenode and datanode folder in your local file system and start hadoop service surely it will take effect
reason for hadoop namenode format hadoop namenode is the centralized place of an hdfs file system which keeps the directory tree of all files in the file system and tracks where across the cluster the file data is kept
the root cause is that the default native library in hadoop is built for 32 bit
i think that the only problem here is the same as in this question so the solution is also the same stop jvm from printing the stack guard warning to stdout stderr because this is what breaks the hdfs starting script
is because you have no ssh authentication
i believe that the cause of this problem is coalesce which despite the fact that it avoids a full shuffle like repartition would do it has to shrink the data in the requested number of partitions
here you are requesting all the data to fit into one partition thus one task and only one task has to work with all the data which may cause its container to suffer from memory limitations
the reason is that repartition 1 will ensure that upstream processing is done in parallel multiple tasks partitions rather than on only one executor
in mapreduce jobs each map or reduce task require to instantiate a new container and the scheduler can block the job to instantiate new containers if it has exceeded its quote based on the queue capacity
source home user hadoop src mapred org apache hadoop mapred jobclient java its constructor tries to fetch the configuration object from jobclient in line 225 but it s null since new jobclient inetsocketaddress jobtrackaddr configuration conf doesn t set it as a workaround set it manually after creating the jobclient object
it turns out that it was because a ds store file was in a folder of root region server and causing a connect exception
and then i search hbase installation on mac since i use mac
it was caused by running start hbase sh without having permissions to connect to the port 2181
anyone if going through these steps still have the issue not resolved leave your issue in the comment section
they are the same in that both can solve the problem that you describe map reduce
they are different in that hadoop is entirely build to solve only that usecase and celey rabbitmq is build to facilitate task execution on different nodes using message passing
rather than cloud pickle doesn t seem to recognise when a custom module has been imported so it seems to try to pickle the top level modules along with the other data that s needed to run the method
for windows directories should be similar to this format c path to dir or file d path to dir i ve tried using hadoop data namenode which prevents starting namenode due to non existence of specified namenode directory
from what i can presume it looks like some crc file is being created and attached to that particular file hence by trying with another file another crc check will be carried out
another reason could be that i have named the file attr txt which could be a conflicting file name with some other resource
maybe someone could expand even more on my answer since i am not 100 sure on the technical details and these are just my observations
if some one makes correction to the crc files the actual and current crc serial numbers would mismatch and it causes the error
since this was my first hadoop experience i could not follow some instruction over the internet
hdfs split files into blocks based on the defined block size
you can implement any other logic compression usually is a foe of the splitting so we employ block compression technique to enable splitting of the compressed data
a lot of your confusion stems from the fact that you are clubbing both of these concepts i hope this makes it a little clearer
the block size is configurable and if it is say 128 mb then whole 128 mb would be one block not 2 blocks of 64 mb separately also it is not necessary that each chunk of a file is stored on a separate datanode a datanode may have more than one chunk of a particular file and a particular chunk may be present in more than one datanodes based upon the replication factor
updates to the file system add remove blocks are not updating the fsimage file but instead are logged into a file so the i o is fast append only streaming as opposed to random file writes
the secondarynamenode job is not to be a secondary to the name node but only to periodically read the filesystem changes log and apply them into the fsimage file thus bringing it up to date
this process may take long time if size of edit log file is big and hence increase startup time
every time we need to make changes permanently in fsimage we need to restart namenode so that edit log information can be written at namenode but it takes a lot of time to do that
the secondary name node will access the edit log and make changes in fsimage permanently so that next time namenode can start up faster
your datanode is not starting because after your namenode and datanode started running you formatted the namenode again
now the files which you have stored for running the word count are still in the datanode and datanode has no idea where to send the block reports since you formatted the namenode so it will not start
d this is the main reason why my datanode was not started
the above problem is occurred due to format the namenode hadoop namenode format without stopping the dfs and yarn daemons
any files folders created inside these are owned by hadoop and may have some reference to the last run datanode details which may have failed or locked due to which the datanode does not star at the next attempt
the typical use case of this is to load a complex data structure one of the element being a key value pair and later in a foreach statement you can refer to a particular value based on the key you are interested in
unfortunately i haven t found it to be that useful though since i typically deal with arbitrary dicts of varying lengths and keys
application failed 2 times because if application master failed for some reason by default it will try to execute the application one more time
if you edit hdfs site xml you ll have to restart the datanode service for the change to take effect
file uri s do need that extra slash so that might be causing these values to revert to the defaults
in my question i also use 1 2k executors so it must be related
this is a hard problem for hdfs to solve on its own so it doesn t
even if you are using multipleoutputs the default outputformat i believe it is textoutputformat is still being used and so it will initialize and creating these part r xxxxx files that you are seeing
the fact that they are empty is because you are not doing any context write because you are using multipleoutputs
you could do i this way note that you are using in your reducer the prototype multipleoutputs write string namedoutput k key v value which just uses a default output path that will be generated based on your namedoutput to something like namedoutput m r part number
if you want to have more control over your output filenames you should use the prototype multipleoutputs write string namedoutput k key v value string baseoutputpath which can allow you to get filenames generated at runtime based on your keys values
this is all you need to do in the driver class to change the basename of the output file job getconfiguration set mapreduce output basename text so this will result in your files being called text r 00000
you just have to do some configurations and simple code as shown below step 1 set dfs support append as true in hdfs site xml stop all your daemon services using stop all sh and restart it again using start all sh step 2 optional only if you have a singlenode cluster so you have to set replication factor to 1 as below through command line or you can do the same at run time through java code step 3 code for creating appending data into the file kindly let me know for any other help
it totally depends on your particular use case
based on your data and the kind of processing you need to decide which tool fits into your requirements better
as a result i had to settle down with mr
so like i said earlier it basically depends on your use case
now that we ve narrowed down the problem run ps p at the command line to determine that you are in fact using a bash shell
so i went to that file etc profile and add source bashrc in that file
then it works since every time a terminal is opened it runs the command in that etc profile file
once in that if your startup run command hasn t been turned on
click the box to turn it on and in the command section type if you made a zsh file if you made a bash profile doing this clear will clear your terminal to a new page so that you don t see your terminal display if you typed the commands as i said you should just get this that way you will be greeted with a clear page with no extra jumbo
however if you are not comfortable doing it you can use the windows short path to set the path name so that all applications can access the path without any hassles
the reason for you error is the space between the program files
path is path java home bin if you are using windows then surely you are going to face issues like due to x64 and x86 issues 1
as other people answered it was because of space in java home path and i had to replace program files with progra 1
version 2 6 2 of hadoop hadoop mapreduce client core can t be used together with guava s new versions i tried 17 0 19 0 since guava s stopwatch constructor can t be accessed causing above illegalaccesserror using hadoop mapreduce client core s latest version 2 7 2 in which they don t use guava s stopwatch in the above method rather they use org apache hadoop util stopwatch solved the problem with two additional dependencies that were required note there are two org apache commons io packages commons io commons io ours here and org apache commons commons io old one 2007
i had this problem with spark 1 6 1 because one of our additional dependencies evicted guava 14 0 1 and replaced it with 18 0
in my case because of adding guava 21 0 result in error
solution multiple versions of guava jar files getting conflicted as transitive dependencies which is causing this exception
in my case after adding pmml evaluator version 1 4 1 dependency caused this exception
it may also be possible to force the desired hadoop mapreduce client core jar file to be used by altering your classpath so that spark finds the version from hadoop rather than the one distributed with spark
because hdfs client will be trying to communicate with datanodes using by address informed by namenode i solved that problem by opening 50010 dfs datanode address port in a firewall
the first thing i realized is i was using ssh tunnel to access the name node and when the client code tries to access data node it can not find the data node due to the tunnel somehow messed up the communication
the reason i used ssh tunnel is i can t access name node remotely and i thought it was due to port restriction by admin so i used ssh tunnel to bypass the restriction
since i found many questions like this one in my search for having the exact same issue i thought i would share what finally worked for me
in my case it was exactly the one mentioned in that post
in the hadoop configuration default replication is set to 3 check it once and change accordingly to your requirements
since i never trust automated processes to delete stuff me personally i ll suggest an alternative instead of trying to overwrite i suggest you make the output name of your job dynamic including the time in which it ran
hadoop already supports the effect you seem to be trying to achieve by allowing multiple input paths to a job
to use the aggregate result as input simply specify the input glob as a wildcard over the subdirectories e g my aggregate output
to append new data to the aggregate as output simply specify a new unique subdirectory of the aggregate as the output directory generally using a timestamp or some sequence number derived from your input data e g
thus when you try to write to the directory again it assumes it has to make a new one write once but it already exists and so it complains
it s better to create a dynamic directory eg based on timestamp or hash value in order to preserve data
if it s just to write to the same flat directory you can write to a different directory and runs a script to migrate the files like hadoop fs mv tmp outputdir in my use case each mapreduce job writes to different sub directories based on the value of the message being writing
i encountered this exact problem it stems from the exception raised in checkoutputspecs in the class fileoutputformat
http mirrors supportex net apache hive hive 1 0 1 apache hive 1 0 1 bin tar gz step 02 add hadoop core 1 1 0 jar as everyone mentioned this error occurs due to the version mismatch with hadoop standalone and hadoop core
the root cause of this problem hadoop install for different user and you start yarn service for different user
hence we need to correct and make it consistent at every place
based on on the first warning hadoop prefix sounds like you ve not defined hadoop home correctly
i got a similar exception stack trace due to improper mapper class set in my code typo notice that mistakenly i was using mapper class from mapreduce package i changed it to my custom mapper class the exception is resolved after i corrected the mapper class
after i change java home in etc profile to usr lib jvm java 6 openjdk which is the same as hadoop env sh and use source etc profile to make etc profile effects my problem is solved
the problem is due to jsp files are getting compiled with higher compiler 8 than expected 7
i also encountered the same problem should use same java version for compile and same or greater on where you are executing it although vice versa cause this error
but since the op asked how to place the file into hdfs the following also performs the hdfs put and note that you can also optionally check that the put succeeded and conditionally remove the local copy
what happens using this approach is that the error is clearly visible if you are having some problem setting the datanodes on the network and also many posts on stackoverflow suggest that namenode requires some time to start off therefore it should be given some time to start before starting the datanodes
usually this situation occur because there are some mistakes in the three site xml files under hadoop install conf and hosts file
in my case the cause is unable to resolve the hostname
you can use jps command as vipin said like this command of course you will change the path of java with the one you have the path you installed java in jps is a nifty tool for checking whether the expected hadoop processes are running part of sun s java since v1 5 0
the result will be something like that i get the answer from this tutorial http www michael noll com tutorials running hadoop on ubuntu linux single node cluster
actually i faced a similar issue in the beginning
edit i just updated the links such that people can choose the appropriate version from the repository since we now come way past the initial version 2
hadoop installation home hadoop data directory var lib hadoop and the directory access bits are 777 so anybody can access
i faced same problem so tried to connect ssh and got statement like not found so i went to the ssh location to debug by the following steps cd ssh ssh keygen t rsa p cat id rsa pub authorized keys then it worked
as on all systems the logs directory needs to be edited by hadoop so it requires the permission to edit the log folder and its contents
this file in ssh specifies the ssh keys that can be used for logging into the user account for which the file is configured
i guess the cause of this problem i use the root user to init the hadoop environment so the several folders were create by root user so that when i now using my own account like jake i don t have permit to start the service during that time the system need to access the logs
so here what s happening is that you re trying to have the line index as a text object which is wrong and you need an longwritable instead so that hadoop doesn t complain about type
from https issues apache org jira browse hadoop 1763 causes might be
for pyspark python users i didn t find anything with python or pyspark so we need to execute hdfs command from python code
this should let you read all the files in the folder keeping only the headers because you drop the malformed
since there s still only one name node the single point of failure spof is there but the probability of failure is still low
writing query in hive like this will always result in using only one reducer
you should use this command to set desired number of reducers set mapred reduce tasks 50 rewrite query as following this will result in 2 map reduce jobs instead of one but performance gain will be substantial
mapper is totaly depend on number of file i e size of file we can call it as input splits
imp note suppose i have specified the split size is 50mb then it will start 3 mapper because of it totally depend on number of split
but the idea is that running multiple tasks in the same executor gives you ability to share some common memory regions so it actually saves memory
start with executor cores 2 double executor memory because executor cores tells also how many tasks one executor will run concurently and see what it does for you
we use spark 1 5 and stopped using executor cores 1 quite some time ago as it was giving gc problems it looks also like a spark bug because just giving more memory wasn t helping as much as just switching to having more tasks per container
i guess tasks in the same executor may peak its memory consumption at different times so you don t waste don t have to overprovision memory just to make it work
i d try to increase memory to spark python worker memory default 512m because of heavy python code and this property value does not count in spark executor memory
bzip2 is splittable in hadoop it provides very good compression ratio but from cpu time and performances is not providing optimal results as compression is very cpu consuming
if you are constructing the gzip file then it can be made with periodic entry points whose index does not need uncompressed history at those entry points making for a smaller index
in short will result in the compare succeeding
you can then simply compress in chunks of the desired size and concatenate the results
you can pick the size of the chunks to your liking depending on your application
remove the property remove readonly for your cygwin installation folder so anyone can write into it run the cygwin terminal as administrator and remove the service by typing cygrunsrv r sshd reboot your system run the cygwin terminal as administrator and reinstall the service again by typing ssh host config y run the cygwin terminal as administrator and start the service by typing net start sshd your service now be running
had been missing so i merely inserted them and copied all other fields from their non english versions
it is because the parent directories do not exist yet either
i was getting the same error while creating data frames on spark shell caused by error xsdb6 another instance of derby may have already booted the database metastore db
cause i found that this is happening as there were multiple other instances of spark shell already running and holding derby db already so when i was starting yet another spark shell and creating data frame on it using rdd todf it was throwing error solution i ran the ps command to find other instances of spark shell ps ef grep spark shell and i killed them all using kill command kill 9 spark shell processid example kill 9 4848 after all the spark shell instances were gone i started a new spark shell and reran my data frame function and it ran just fine
an lck lock file is an access control file which locks the database so that only a single user can access or update the database
thus you need to delete the lck files
if you are facing issue during bringing up was application on windows machine kill java processes using task manager delete db lck file present in websphere appserver profiles appsrv04 databases ejbtimers server1 ejbtimerdb my db is ejbtimerdb which was causing issue restart application
i got this error by running sqlcontext get hive ctx this was caused by initially trying to load a pipelined rdd into a dataframe i got the error exception you must build spark with hive
export spark hive true and run build sbt assembly py4jjavaerror u an error occurred while calling none org apache spark sql hive hivecontext n javaobject id o29 so you could running this before rebuilding it but fyi i have seen others reporting this did not help them
the error came because of the multiple spark shell you are trying to run in same node or due to system failure its shut down without proper exit the spark shell in any of the reason you just find out the process id and kill them for that us
so when you execute this command the reason you are seeing the error is ls
no such file or directory because hadoop is looking for this path home ubuntu it seems like this path doesn t exist in hdfs
the reason why this command is working because you have explicitly specified path and is the root of the hdfs
hence if you want to specify local file system path use file url scheme
the user directory in hadoop is in hdfs if you get this error message it may be because you have not yet created your user directory within hdfs
there are a couple things at work here based on jarlib is referring to the hdfs file location it sounds like you indeed have an hdfs path set as your fs default name which is indeed the typical setup
the error message is unfortunately somewhat confusing since it doesn t tell you that
when running a distributed configuration it is best to set java home in this file so that it is correctly defined on remote nodes
try echo java home in that script
in pseudo distributed environment hadoop works on localhost so the java home in bash profile is no use anymore
the reason is as matiji66 say but the root reason he didn t talk about is the hadoop speculative so the really reason is that your task execute slow then hadoop run another task to do the same thing in my case is to save data to a file on hadoop when one task of the two task finished it will delete the temp file and the other after finished it will delete the same file then it does not exists so the exception happened you can fix it by close the speculative of spark and hadoop
for my case another program read write and delete this tmp file cause this error
root cause storage policy was set on staging directory and hence mapreduce job failed
see the problem the reason why this would happen is basically what zohar said the saveashadoopfile method with multipletextoutputformat actually doesn t allow multiple programs concurrently running to save files to the same directory
because of this i stopped the service
value for property fs default name in core site xml on both the master and slave machine must point to master machine so it will be something like this where master is the hostname in etc hosts file pointing to the master node
i have face same issue in my single node cluster
i had obtained the same error in my case it was due to a bad configuration of the hosts files first i have modified the hosts file of the master node adding the ips of the slaves and also in each datanode i have modified the hosts files to indicate the ips of the namenode and the rest of slaves
it is probably because the cluster id of the datanodes and the namenodes or node manager do not match
i thought that datanodes started because they appeared up when running jps but when trying to upload files i was receiving the message 0 nodes running
in fact neither the web interface to http nn1 50070 was working because of the firewall
i disabled the firewall when installing hadoop but for some reason it was up
this error is caused by the block replication system of hdfs since it could not manage to make any copies of a specific block within the focused file
common reasons of that only a namenode instance is running and it s not in safe mode there is no datanode instances up and running or some are dead
running datanode instances are not able to talk to the server because of some networking of hadoop based issues check logs that include datanode info there is no hard disk space specified in configured data directories for datanode instances or datanode instances have run out of space
another reason could be that your datanode machine hasn t exposed the port 50010 by default
if they are running then it means that they could not connect with the namenode and hence the namenode thinks there are no datanodes in the hadoop system
this is the contents of my core site xml so the vm sm alias in the master computer maps to the 127 0 1 1
this is because of the setup of my etc hosts file
due to the logs containing unavailablestorages disk i removed the ssd tag which solved the problem
the problem connecting recource manager was because ive needed to add a few properties to yarn site xml yet my jobs arent runing but connecting is successful now
the proper way might be adding the following lines in yarn site xml because the value field host represent a single hostname that can be set in place of setting all yarn resourcemanager address resources
results in default ports for resourcemanager components
results in default ports for resourcemanager components
one of them is resourcemanager which is responsible for allocating resources to the various applications running in the cluster
this issue might be due to the missing hadoop conf dir which is needed by the mapreduce application to connect to the resource manager which is mentioned in yarn site xml
this error has occurred because the resource manager has failed to start
it means the amount of memory yarn can utilize on this node and therefore this property should be lower than the total memory of that machine
we want to allow for a maximum of 20 containers on each node and thus need 40 gb total ram 20 of containers 2 gb minimum per container controlled by property yarn scheduler minimum allocation mb again we want to restrict maximum memory utilization for a container controlled by property yarn scheduler maximum allocation mb for example if one job is asking for 2049 mb memory per map container mapreduce map memory mb 2048 set in mapred site xml rm will give it one 4096 mb 2 yarn scheduler minimum allocation mb container
exit codes greater than 128 these exit codes most likely result from a program shutdown triggered by a unix signal
workaround 1 start from scratch i can testify that the following steps solve this error but the side effects won t make you happy me neither
workaround 2 updating namespaceid of problematic datanodes big thanks to jared stehler for the following suggestion
i had the same issue on pseudo node using hadoop1 1 2 so i ran bin stop all sh to stop the cluster then saw the configuration of my hadoop tmp directory in hdfs site xml so i went into root data hdfstmp and deleted all the files using command you may loose ur data and then format namenode again and then start the cluster using main reason is bin hadoop namenode format didn t remove the old data
i had the same issue on pseudo node using hadoop1 1 2 so i ran bin stop all sh to stop the cluster then saw the configuration of my hadoop tmp directory in hdfs site xml so i went into root data hdfstmp and deleted all the files using command you may loose ur data and then format namenode again and then start the cluster using main reason is bin hadoop namenode format didn t remove the old data so we have to delete it manually
thanks to the first reply for helping me to figure out what folder i needed to bomb
cd hadoop hadoopdata hdfs 2 look in the folder and you will see what file you have in hdfs ls 3 delete the datanode folder because it is old version of datanode rm rf datanode 4 you will get the new version after run the previous command 5 start new datanode hadoop daemon sh start datanode 6 refresh the web services
download hadoop binary link and put it in your home directory you can choose a different hadoop version if you like and change the next steps accordingly unzip the folder in your home directory using the following command
reason is association with yarn cluster may be lost due to the java 8 excessive memory allocation issue https issues apache org jira browse yarn 4714 you can force yarn to ignore this by setting up the following properties in yarn site xml thanks to simplejack reference from spark pi example in cluster mode with yarn association lost
it may be that spark assumes the partition is dead because it it not fetching more records for a long time and hence we get this exception
for some reason the jar hadoop aws version jar which contains the implementation to natives3filesystem is not present in the classpath of hadoop by default in the version 2 6 2 7
perhaps this is because it sounds like hadoop home is being deprecated
in that case i m using this extremely cludgy export export hadoop classpath hadoop classpath brew prefix hadoop libexec share hadoop tools lib
according to the hadoop the definitive guide btw nice book would recommend to buy it so you can create a new whoami command which returns the required username and put it in the path appropriately so that the created whoami is found before the actual whoami which comes with linux is found
i m exporting the hadoop user name in bash profile so that every time i m logging in the user is set
result
since without specifying the uri in filesystem it will look for hdfs ones
azure blog storage is mapped to a hdfs location so all the hadoop operations on azure portal go to storage account you will find following details storage account key container path pattern users accountsdata date format yyyy mm dd event serialization format json format line separated path pattern here is the hdfs path you can login putty to the hadoop edge node and do above command will list all the files
because you re using scala you may also be interested in the following this will unfortunately return the entire output of the command as a string and so parsing down to just the filenames requires some effort
it does not need to be paired with hadoop but since hadoop is one of the most popular big data processing tools spark is designed to work well in that environment
for example hadoop uses the hdfs hadoop distributed file system to store its data so spark is able to read data from hdfs and to save results in hdfs
once loaded into memory spark can run many transformations on the data set to calculate a desired result
the final result is then typically written back to durable storage
for example a multi pass map reduce operation can be dramatically faster in spark than with hadoop map reduce since most of the disk i o of hadoop is avoided
spark can be set up to ingest incoming real time data and process it in micro batches and then save the result to durable storage such as hdfs cassandra etc
download hadoop 2 2 0 src tar gz and extract to a folder having short path say c hdfs to avoid runtime problem due to maximum path length limitation in windows
i don t know google pointed it out by searching header file names i ve copied hadoop 2 2 0 src hadoop common project hadoop common target winutils debug libwinutils lib result of step 1 into hadoop 2 2 0 src hadoop common project hadoop common target bin and finally build operation produces hadoop dll
i ran into same problem with hadoop 2 4 1 on windows 8 1 there were a few differences with the resulting solution caused mostly by the newer os
maven ran fine from a standard windows command prompt in that directory mvn package dskiptests
path causing exception hdfs localhost 8020 correct path hdfs localhost 8020 hbase
hive schema 2 x x mysql sql file depends on the version available in the current directory
try to go for the latest because it holds many old schema files also
in the middle of the stack trace lost in the reflection junk you can find the root cause the specified datastore driver com mysql jdbc driver was not found in the classpath
this is probably due to its lack of connections to the hive meta store my hive meta store is stored in mysql so i need to visit mysql so i add a dependency in my build sbt and the problem is solved
by default spark submit takes client mode which has following advantage while in cluster mode here it s not able to access hive metastore due to unavailability of hive jar to any of the nodes in cluster
no such file or directory is because there is no home dir on hdfs for your current user
this could also happen due to bad carriage return characters
updates 2016 07 04 since the last update mongodb spark connector matured quite a lot
it provides up to date binaries and data source based api but it is using sparkconf configuration so it is subjectively less flexible than the stratio spark mongodb
2016 03 30 since the original answer i found two different ways to connect to mongodb from spark mongodb mongo spark stratio spark mongodb while the former one seems to be relatively immature the latter one looks like a much better choice than a mongo hadoop connector and provides a spark sql api
you can find complete source on github doi 10 5281 zenodo 47882 and build it from scratch or download an image i ve pushed to docker hub so you can simply docker pull zero323 mongo spark start images start pyspark shell passing jars and driver class path and finally see how it works please note that mongo hadoop seems to close the connection after the first action
based on different problems i ve encountered creating this image i tend to believe that passing mongo hadoop 1 5 0 snapshot jar and mongo hadoop spark 1 5 0 snapshot jar to both jars and driver class path is the only hard requirement
notes this image is loosely based on jaceklaskowski docker spark so please be sure to send some good karma to jacek laskowski if it helps
on the other hand the overall stability of the codebase is quite good so one may do a github fork and cut a branch on its own from current master as well of course with the usual quality measures
in most cases a static approach fits the needs quite well in that case thrift lets you benefit from the better performance of generated code
however it is based on google s internal rpc system which has seen some 12 years of development
they are all very much in use at plenty of places so i d say your first assumption
since hive does not do any transformation to our input data the format needs to be the same either the file should be in orc format or we can load data from a text file to a text table in hive
orc file is a binary file format so you can not directly load text files into orc tables
as a result the speed of data processing also increases
steps to load data into orc file format in hive 1 create one normal table using textfile format 2 load the data normally into this table 3 create one table with the schema of the expected results of your normal hive table using stored as orcfile 4 insert overwrite query to copy the data from textfile table to orcfile table refer the blog to learn the handson of how to load data into all file formats in hive load data into all file formats in hive
for me the full path i e hdfs nn1home 8020 is not working for some strange reason
when i started hadoop and did jps i couldn t find datanode so i tried to manually start datanode using bin hadoop datanode
i have got details of the issue in the log file like below invalid directory in dfs data dir incorrect permission for home hdfs dnman1 expected rwxr xr x while actual rwxrwxr x and from there i identified that the datanote file permission was 777 for my folder
in my case i have hadoop on windows over c this file according to core site xml etc it was in tmp administrator dfs data name etc so erase it
whenever you are getting below error trying to start a dn on a slave machine it is because after you set up your cluster you for whatever reason decided to reformat your nn
datanode dies because of incompatible clusterids compared to the namenode
i got similar issue in my pseudo distributed environment
here the datanode gets stopped immediately because the clusterid of datanode and namenode are different
the reason i was using it is that it runs on my windows 10 since it uses java vm plus it has very good graphics in 2d 3d which can be exported to the vector graphics format
this works because when you clear a task s status the scheduler will treat it as if it hadn t run before for this dag run
since hadoop 3 0 0 alpha 1 there was a change in the port configuration http localhost 50070 was moved to http localhost 9870 see https issues apache org jira browse hdfs 9427
if you are in a pseudo distributed mode you must have the following proccesses namenode jobtracker tasktracker datanode secondarynamenode if you are missing any use the restart commands it can also be because you haven t open that port on the machine
hadoop version 2 6 4 step 1 check whether your namenode has been formated if not type step 2 check your namenode tmp file path to see in tmp if the namenode directory is in tmp you need set tmp path in core site xml because every time when you reboot or start your machine the files in tmp will be removed you need set a tmp dir path
if you are running and old version of hadoop hadoop 1 2 you got an error because http localhost 50070 dfshealth html does nt exit
you can turn off reducers by specifing 0 reducers in hadoop jar command implicitly so the result command will be following to be backward compatible hadoop also supports the reduce none option which is equivalent to d mapred reduce tasks 0
you can add your mapper in the property mapreduce map class and also there will be no need to add the property mapreduce reduce class since reducers are not required
i m sure there s a good reason for this that i don t know yet because i m literally trying to use hive for the first time today
however i can t find either metastore db or metastore db tmp folder under install path so i tried find usr name hive schema 2 0 0 derby sql vi usr local cellar hive 2 0 1 libexec scripts metastore upgrade derby hive schema 2 0 0 derby sql comment the nucleus ascii function and nucleus matches function rerun schematool dbtype derby initschema then everything goes well
the problem is osx specific it is due to the fact that by default the filesystem is set to case insensitive on a mac case preserving but case insensitive which to my opinion is very bad
since i use maven to build my project i was able to get around it by adding a line in my maven pom xml like this
this is problem mostly get because of the space issues
in my case i just renamed the file log test txt because the os ubuntu was trying to generate a folder with the same name
on a mac sasl should be available if you ve installed xcode developer tools xcode select install in terminal after installation you can connect to hive like this now that you have the hive connection you have options how to use it
i assert that you are using hiveserver2 which is the reason that makes the code doesn t work
here s a generic approach which makes it easy for me because i keep connecting to several servers sql teradata hive etc
hence i use the pyodbc connector
note that your jdbc connection url will depend on the authentication mechanism you are using
you are now ready to make the connection via python if you only care about reading then you can read it directly into a panda s dataframe with ease via eycheu s solution otherwise here is a more versatile communication option you could imagine if you wanted to create a table you would not need to fetch the results but could submit a create table query instead
you don t need to copy anything or change permissions because of previous points
here the user root since you are using sudo does not have access to the hdfs directory input
you can use below statement to write the contents of dataframe in csv format df write csv data home csv if you need to write the whole dataframe into a single csv file then use df coalesce 1 write csv data home sample csv for spark 1 x you can use spark csv to write the results into csv files below scala snippet would help to write the contents into a single file
since spark 2 x spark csv is integrated as native datasource
therefore the necessary statement simplifies to windows or unix notice as the comments say it is creating the directory by that name with the partitions in it not a standard csv file
this however is most likely what you want since otherwise your either crashing your driver out of ram or you could be working with a non distributed environment
the answer above with spark csv is correct but there is an issue the library creates several files based on the data frame partitioning
hadoop error java home is not set above error is because of the space in between two words
eg java located in c program files java space in between program and files would cause the above problem
on a hadoop cluster with yarn you can fetch the logs including stdout with for some reason i ve found this to be more complete than what i see in the webinterface
in addition i ve covered all the exception cases i hit along the way and what i believe to be the cause of each and how to fix them
i tried with hadoop aws 2 7 2 but was still getting lots of errors so we went back to 2 7 1
key points the direct output committer is gone from spark 2 0 due to risk experience of data corruption
you don t have to put where i put it please replace it based on your hadoop directory
in etc hosts add this line your ip address your host name example 192 168 1 8 master in etc hosts delete the line with 127 0 1 1 this will cause loopback in your core site change localhost to your ip or your hostname now restart the cluster
connection refused problem might also be due to no active datanode
hadoop setup could be frustrating some time due to the complexity of the system and many moving parts involved
also provide info if returns any result or not
i am also facing same issue in hortonworks at the time i restart the ambari agents and servers then the issue has been resolved
i was getting the same issue and found that openssh service was not running and it was causing the issue
unfortunately the above solution does not fix the problem with this version edit i found the solution to this based on a hint i saw here
as you suggest these distributed querying algorithms have the potential to require more total processing power than the equivalent join in a properly indexed relational database but because they are parallelized the real time performance is orders of magnitude better than any single machine could do assuming a machine that could hold the entire index even exists
well i shouldn t say done because ongoing operations and development at this scale are a lot harder than the single server app but the point is application servers are typically trivial to scale via a share nothing architecture as long as they can get the data they need in a timely fashion
in practice you will probably need to build up and maintain your own data access layer that s suited to your particular needs because data profiles at these scales are going to vary dramatically and i believe there are too many tradeoffs for a general purpose tool to emerge and become dominant the way rdbmss have
however now that a lot of applications are moving to the web and more and more of the world s population is online inevitably more and more applications will have to scale and best practices will begin to crystallize
in particular second and third normal form violations are not a problem since data warehouses are rarely updated
since you don t have to worry about updates you don t decompose things down to the 2nf level where an update can t lead to anomalous relationships
the orm issues are largely moot since the data is pre joined
to find those values in the relational database the engine should do the following things find out where the tuple containing the first value resides find the second value find the address of the root in a b tree holding the data the second number refers to traverse this tree find the pointer to the actual table which may be stored as a b tree itself in which case the pointer is the value of the primary key of the row we re after find the table s row by the pointer or traverse the table finally get the result
if your application depends on knowing the precise figure at any given moment then you shouldn t be using bigtable for it is the general attitude
you can get pretty large with relational dbs as so demonstrates so i shall continue to enjoy the relational goodness for now
after trying so many combinations finally i concluded the same error on my environment ubuntu 12 04 hadoop 1 0 4 is due to two issues
on ubuntu using deb install at least for hadoop 1 2 1 there is a etc profile d hadoop env sh symlink created to etc hadoop hadoop env sh which causes it to load every time you log in
on my system i ve removed the symlink and i no longer get weird issues when changing the value for xmx in hadoop client options because every time that hadoop env sh script is run the client options environment variable is updated though keeping the old value
this command is really verbose especially on a large hdfs filesystem so i normally get down to the meaningful output with which ignores lines with nothing but dots and lines talking about replication
if you can find a problem in that way and bring the block back online that file will be healthy again
once you determine what happened and you cannot recover any more blocks just use the command to get your hdfs filesystem back to healthy so you can start tracking new errors as they occur
point to be noted here is whenever i executed a select query for a particular value in the partitioning column or created a static partition it worked fine as in that case error records were being skipped
when opened the dashboard looked like this in that dashboard you can find your failed application and then after clicking into it you can look at the logs of the individual map and reduce jobs
for some reason it was not surfacing the java outofmemory errors i got earlier though
one of the common causes that we saw in our team for this error code was when the query was not optimized well
a known reason was when we do an inner join with the left side table magnitudes bigger than the table on right side
thanks to this post hive elasticsearch write operation 409
as the data was coming through flume and had interrupted in between due to which may be there was inconsistency in few files
format consistency was the reason in my case
i faced the same issue because i didn t have permission to query the database i was trying to
here is what you can find in the official documentation a way to work around this limitation is to use partitions i don t know what you id corresponds to but if you re getting different batches of ids separately you could redesign your table so that it is partitioned by id and then you would be able to easily drop partitions for the ids you want to get rid of
but the following alternative could be used to achieve the result update records in a partitioned hive table the main table is assumed to be partitioned by some key
the tables are joined via a left outer join and the result is used to overwrite the partitions in the main table
you can delete rows from a table using a workaround in which you overwrite the table by the dataset you want left into the table as a result of your operation
also obviously doing this can muck up your data so a backup of the table is adviced and care when planning the deletion rule also adviced
because the ip that the client received for the datanode is an internal ip and not the public ip
i had the same error on macos x 10 7 hadoop 0 20 2 cdh3u0 due to data node not starting
i think that s why the solution checking the health status works because you go to the health status webpage and wait for everything up my five cents
my ubuntu 10 04 server required a slightly different configuration for this to work properly so you may need to alter your approach accordingly
however due to hive 3816 running hive with mapred job tracker local results in a call to the hive cli executable installed on the system as described in your question
hortonworks is one of 2 leading hadoop distribution providers so it is well supported
i m uncertain of what has changed since the accepted answer in feb 2014 but as of hive 1 2 0 the following works around the issue described by op do be aware of the warning given in the config documentation this works around the issue because in mapredlocaltask java the default config value causes the executeinchildvm method to be called which literally calls hadoop jar
thanks to npe adding to pom xml did the trick
i also faced this problem because i just only installed jre not with jdk
so adding dependency for jdk tools can t fix for me because tools jar was not exist at my java home lib directory
edit this comment is not applicable anymore now that you ve edited your question
but it is because virtual memory usage is more than expected for given physical memory
note this is happening on centos rhel 6 due to its aggressive allocation of virtual memory
i can t comment on the accepted answer due to low reputation
based on your application you need to check if enabling combiner helps or not
it might be caused by some of the following ssh server is not installed only ssh client try apt get install ssh openssh client openssh server connection is blocked by iptables firewall try ufw allow ssh
for example if my hostname is ub0 but the hostname in etc hosts is localhost it may occur because the hostname in etc hosts is localhost not ub0
another possible cause though the ops question doesn t itself suffer from this is if you create a configuration instance that does not load the defaults if you don t load the defaults then you won t get the default settings for things like the filesystem implementations which leads to identical errors like this when trying to access hdfs
it took me sometime to figure out fix from given answers due to my newbieness
this is not related to flink but i ve found this issue in flink also
output the result in the final sorted partion i e
if you see the source in shell java in common package you will find that hadoop home variable is not getting set and you are receiving null in place of that and hence the error
now create a folder bin inside folder winutils and copy the winutils exe in that folder
i was getting the same issue in windows
additionally i preferred using cross platform tool cygwin to settle linux os functionality as possible as it can because hbase team recommend linux unix env
also after the above command i would suggest you to once run hadoop fsck so that any inconsistencies crept in the hdfs might be sorted out
i actually could not use the hadoop dfsadmin safemode leave because i was running hadoop in a docker container and that command magically fails when run in the container so what i did was this
as a result the hdfs becomes readable only
try this check status of safemode if it is still in safemode then one of the reason would be not enough space in your node you can check your node disk usage using if root partition is full delete files or add space in your root partition and retry first step
spark csv is part of core spark functionality and doesn t require a separate library so you could just do for example in scala this works for any format in delimiter mention for csv t for tsv etc val df sqlcontext read format com databricks spark csv option delimiter load csvfile csv
there are a lot of challenges to parsing a csv file it keeps adding up if the file size is bigger if there are non english escape separator other characters in the column values that could cause parsing errors
the reason you saw that warning is the native hadoop library hadoop home lib native libhadoop so 1 0 0 was actually compiled on 32 bit
first i can confirm that you must recompile native libraries to 64 bit arm other answers here based on setting some environment variables won t work
here are my indications pour hadoop 2 8 there is still no protobuf package on latest raspbian so you must compile it yourself and version must be exactly protobuf 2 5 https protobuf googlecode com files protobuf 2 5 0 tar gz cmake file patching method must be changed
note that io typedbytes or d stream map input typedbytes should not be used explicitly asking for typedbytes leads to the misinterpretation i described in my question
note that this might vary slightly depending on your hadoop distribution i am using cloudera s
since the servlet container you are using will usually ship with its own javax servlet dependency your exclusion needs to catch this case
this might be because there s another process maybe another hiveserver already listening on port 10000
since cdh4 ships apache hadoop 2 x with an mr1 0 20 1 x mr framework option pig here is getting confused on what to expect
split is not supported because it would return an array and complex types are not yet supported by impala
your sqoop command will be sqoop job create incjob import connect jdbc mysql localhost retail db username root p table sample merge key id target dir user cloudera incremental lastmodified check column updated time m 1 since you have specified only one mapper there is no need of split by
much more on proxies here http ofps oreilly com titles 9781449396107 clients html incidentally you almost never want this setup all client machines should be able to communicate directly with regionservers so that you don t end up with a bottleneck at your hbase proxy server
note that put zlib h directory in path is wrong and not necessary only zlib bin directory is needed as said in building guide https svn apache org viewvc hadoop common branches branch 2 building txt view markup also zlib h requires some header not present in windows so you will need to download those headers and put in the same folder with zlib h
the key solution should be editing sln and vcxprj file of winutils and native package so that they are compatible with win32 platform
reason i used glue to read data from mysql to s3 and the reads are not parallel has aws support looks at it and that s how glue which uses pyspark work but writing to s3 once the read is complete its parallel
use spark dataframe partitionby date write parquet location s3 mybucket table name daily perform the msck repair on the hive table so the new partition is added to the table
yarn will export all of the environment variables listed here https github com apache hadoop blob trunk hadoop yarn project hadoop yarn hadoop yarn api src main java org apache hadoop yarn api applicationconstants java l117 so you should be able to access it like
is there a reason you need to use localcheckpoint vs checkpoint
because it seems like orc writer cannot handle adding abnormally large rows to a stripe
from the comments since the hive table named test already exists directly query the table with the created sparksession
with hadoop 1 the map and reduce slots per node are set at the daemon level and thus require a restart of the tasktracker daemons if the value is changed
the trick here is 1 have a single reducer and 2 choose your 00000 word so that it gets sorted before all other words
at least not default options because it only reads line delimited files not xml formatting if you want to process xml in parallel opt for something like spark xml or pre process the xml documents before they even enter hdfs into a more hadoop friendly format for example using something like apache nifi xml xpath processors
as we need the final result as dataframe let s use schemardd which returned from hivecontext sql
note also depending on the vendor if the hbase cluster was ever started in secure mode the created znode will be hbase secure
by default it is 40 means a tasktracker will fetch data by 40 http threads so it can server for 40 reducers minimum at time it can go high as well
this is because your jobtracker is in safemode and not the namenode
since the error did not specify what label was missing
looking at the datatracker logs i noticed there was not enough free space for the single reducer to run on any of my nodes this 503gb refers to the free space available on one of the hard drives on the particular slave tracker slave01 mydomain com thus the reducer apparently needs to copy all the data to a single drive
the reason this happens is your table only has one region when it is brand new
of course i think this runs into the same problem with regions so you ll want to create the regions ahead of time too i think
the main reason of this is hfileoutputformat starts reducer that sorts and merges data to be loaded in hbase table
the hdfs protocol is the same for both implementations so this could work
i can t reproduce that it is very odd that you see a conversion to mapjoin you should not see that since your query has no joins in it
odd this works for me however since you specify that your table is sorted you also need to set i m wondering if the combination of bucket sort table and only setting one of the enforce setting messes it up somehow
hence the namenode didnt started
since it builds against 1 1 1 by default
typical csv file formats have quotation characters around the string fields and thus detecting embedded newlines in fields is simplified by noting the newline is inside quotes
you do not have quote characters but you do have knowledge of the number of fields so you can detect when a newline would lead to the premature end of the record
the brute force method uses flatten so that for each transaction in each input record you send the key and the transaction to some reducer
it s the data nodes which store the actual information for a file hence the redirect if you want to have a single proxy node by which you don t have to deal with the data nodes in this way then you want to configure httpfs instead
cause in the code of aggregateimplementation s getsum method it handle all the returned keyvalue as long
this is because ulimit is a bash built in
its quite a possibility that multiple instances of hive on different putty terminal are running this answer is not in reference with cloudera and may be just one reason for the error
calculating on the local filesystem you just need to chop the file into the blocks calculate the crc of each block collect all crcs together and calculate md5sum of the result
due to static reader which used to call the above method without synchronization was making this problem
personally i think installing hadoop on 32 bit linux is a little silly since the whole point of hadoop is to process big data so you probably want machines with more than 4gb of ram
however since the rowlock was not used not passed to put constructor when i call the unlockrow method the method waits for 60 seconds lock timeout to check if the lock has been used
ever since i haven t see this kind of problem
fixed this issue actually while installing java i downloaded floatingdecimal jar manually from maven repository which was causing issue
i was getting similar error on my hive console while runing hive commands create does not exist query returned non zero code 1 cause create does not exist i resolved this problem by setting the hive run as user setting
answering your question my hypothesis based on the functionality of each component the namenode only handles metadata information managing only the location of blocks and servers with requests and responses using little bandwidth on the network
the datanode is responsible for massive data using the network bandwidth in its entirety since it transfers the big data hence the dropped packets
i am using this and my program is running successfully on ec2 instance with mahout and hadoop but i am not able to get relevant results
with your configuration i don t know if parallelization of writes improve your performances because you want to write one file
others solutions usage of a marker file is not the best option because you lose an hdfs block by default block size if 128 mb
recreating the file from its parts is similar to a rewriting of data so it is inefficient
and then use the hive create table command using row format delimited fields terminated by escaped by you can use a regex that takes care of the comma enclosed within double quotes so first you apply a regex to data as shown in hortonworks apache manuals regexp extract col value
then modify the expression to account for enclosed commas
the problem you are having is that by the looks of your input data the control characters have been written as plain text so a will not be recognised as character 001
this is not as simple since you need to use a regexserde and this does not allow to use column types such as map or array
due to the columnar nature of rcfiles the row wise read path is significantly different from the write path
lastly i ve added an emr bootstrap custom step where you can add the bash script so it can run before the php streaming step
i prefere rjdbc to rhive because rhive needs complex installations on all the node of the cluster and i don t really understand why
if you want to run it from another machine you can but if it is windows you will likely have trouble since the libraries are built on linux
as i see it there are three ways to handle this and the best one depends on how your cache file will grow
this feature is supported since hadoop 2 3 0 hdfs caching lets users explicitly cache certain files or directories in hdfs
this would still result in network communication for non local replicas but hopefully less than a transfer to all nodes in a distributedcache
looks like it could be because of two reasons may be some other instance of resource manager already running that uses the port
according to the docs this will come when the result is too large to be represented by a long
does the tasktracker on node1 sit idle since there is no datanode service on that node
nope due to data locality principle the task tracker will not process the data from other nodes 3
do we get errors from tasktracker service on node1 due to the dn on it s node being down
task tracker will not be able to process any data so no errors
when client requests for the processing of the data name node tells the client about the data locations so based on the data locations all other applications will communicate with data nodes
this should result in the node being blacklisted by m r after n failures default is 3 i think
however jobs should still finish since the tasks that got routed to the bad node will simply be retried on other nodes
now since one of your data node in the cluster is failed name node will not store the data in that node
even if it tries to store also it gets the frequent updates from data node about the status so it will not choose that specific data node to store the data
we run camusjob which is responsible for getting data from kafka using comman line the problem is that new hosts didn t get so called yarn gateway
surely using something like zookeeper is a possibility but most likely it is going to be a bottleneck of your flow so it is generally not recommended
if the number of page ids is too large in your use case you may want to pre partition the input by webpage id so that each mapper will receive only a limited subset of page ids thus keeping the max date tracking map manageable in memory
the solution depends on how large your dataset is
that might be another reason
sometimes it have been seen that people forget to start the service metastore and thereafter as well as also to enter the hive bash shell and start passing the commands in similar way of sqoop when i were the newbie i were also facing these things so to overcome of this issue goto the hive directory pass bin hive service metastore so it will start the hive metastore server for you and later open another terminal or cli pass bin hive so it will let you enter inside the hive bash shell
this is related to a number of issues in hbase 1 0 x hbase 11575 hbase 13453 and hbase 13479
but after that you never need to check against null since you are sure that your method never returns null
sqlstdconfonlyauthorizerfactory class has been added in hive 0 14 0 version hive 8045 but spark 1 2 depends on hive 0 13
so either include your hive exec 0 14 0 jar in classpath and before spark s own hive jars or change your entry in hive site xml to something like this former is not recommended since similar issues may arise further due to hive version mismatch
i think this happens because you have duplicate jars on the classpath
that has a negative impact on compression quality and will probably lead to more disc usage
since this length info is not updated by hsync it will incorrectly stop reading even though the data is actually available
give one of the following commands a try they depend on your os sudo etc rc d sysctl reload or sudo sysctl p etc sysctl conf
since i can t comment on the answer posted by saseaturtle
finally i successfully installed pydoop by using the following command my guess is that all the above problem came from environment setting since the command was run as sudo
with small input reduce method is called only once and hence you are not facing this issue
your mapper is performing some task which is taking more than 600 seconds the nodemanager thinks its dead and hence killing it
the new api favors abstract classes over interfaces since these are easier to evolve
please consider the below case as per you memory resource number of container are dependent on the number of blocksize
this because hdfs nodes are not running go to will start all processes
that is because you have partitioned data on hiredate but trying add partition on gender column
for this reason you are getting this message it does not mean add a new column partition called gender which has the data located somewhere
unfortunately the job jar itself is the last one in the classpath so it is impossible to override a config by putting your modified container log4j properties as a resource of your jar
i think this is because mahot expects a hadoop installation to be available
reading through small files normally causes lots of seeks and lots of hopping from datanode to datanode to retrieve each small file all of which is an inefficient data access pattern
sequencefiles are splittable so mapreduce can break them into chunks and operate on each chunk independently
block compression is the best option in most cases since it compresses blocks of several records rather than per record if you are producing lots of small files then depending on the access pattern a different type of storage might be more appropriate
however there is a much easier way to make the transformations you want using hive built in functions upper string a returns the string resulting from converting all characters of a to upper case
for example upper foobar results in foobar
mapping hive tables on hbase tables means that every hive query triggers a full scan on hbase side then the result is fed to a mapreduce batch job that does the filters and the joins
if you expect sub second results try some small data technologies e g
for sub minutes results you might give a try to apache phoenix it s a hbase wrapper with indexes and some kind of sql
i mean instead of using the default fileinputformat you use the mongoinputformat which implements the inputformat interface and thus provides a method for getting a list of splits which will be some kind of constant sized partition of the data within mongodb e g
being said that if for any reason you still want to dump the data to hdfs your best bet is creating a script in charge of reading the mongodb data and transforming it into ngsi like notifications understable by cygnus then cygnus will do the rest of the work
the issue might be because you don t have such user yarn in hdfs
i just renamed it to hive log4j2 properties since your hive logs into this property
it is because codehaus org no longer hosts maven repos
by default oozie builds against hadoop version 0 23 5 so to build against hadoop 2 7 1 we will have to configure maven dependencies in pom xml in the downloaded oozie source code pom xml the hadoop 2 maven profile specifies hadoop version hadoop auth version to be 2 3 0 so we need to change them to use 2 7 1
if automatic fail over is not enables you can trigger using below yarn rmadmin transitiontostandby rm1 please do above changes and give reply with result
thanks to tmbt see comments above i found an additional error in the solr logs claiming unidentified field anchor
this problem can be worked around by moving the virtual environment to a new directory and setting permissions so that it can be executed by all users
however it is not a satisfying solution because there may be privacy security concerns with making the interpreter readable executable to all users
then for absolutely no reasonable reason it just worked
if not since it s been a while since you posted that and the problem may be fixed already please share with us the solution that you may have found so that others facing the same issue can find it
one heads up though after login eclipse terminal will start from the home directory so it would be better to do a pwd before using the login command in order to copy the directory path and do a cd to the exact directory you intended
if your code is compiling successfully then that means that guava version 12 0 or higher is available on your compilation classpath at build time but since version 11 0 2 is supplied at runtime by hadoop the method doesn t exist resulting in nosuchmethoderror
hadoop 11656 is an unimplemented feature request that would isolate hadoop s internal dependencies away from clients so that you could more easily use common libraries like guava at your desired version
thanks to the java 7 diamond operator it won t even be much more verbose
external variables are case sensitive because mysql and mysql are differents
type mysql in command line see the result
hdfs has single writer semantics so only one process can hold a file open for writing at a time
in my case i had moved a subset of disks from one node to another node that already had disks and disabled the old node so there was a problem with the disks not matching the datanodeuuid of the new machine
then reformat these namenode each other but this option cause the error below
it looks as though this is because of your job 2 inputformat
otherwise error stack will read also caused by gssexception no valid credentials provided down right after gss initiate failed
to confirm that your server and client can authenticate in that one domain and its domain configurations are correct krb5 conf etc
do kinit k t hive keytab hive cdh 542 kerberos informatica com infaqakerb like you did klist do this on server and client side and copy paste result here
regarding the second error most probably it is because the stored data in hdfs is in json format most probably stored by the cygnus tool and a json serializerdeserializer serde must be set
followed every instruction but the hdfs plugin didn t take effect
it might be caused by using control c to exit spark shell and leaving several users with a sparkcontext going at the same time
they will usually point to the line that triggered the job not the problem so it is usually some save or collect operation
it is not clear why and i ve found that usually when spark does not give a reason memory is a good place to start
since your hdfs datanodes are not working and you have checked with jps command
expose functionality is separated from publish host mapping functionality because there are cases where one would like to expose to port to other containers without mapping it to the host
when i add the hostname to the hosts file it resolves the issue as opposed to depending on dns for the current host
because there is no reference for it
as part of the upgrade process the configurations will be amended to account for the issue you experienced and will be corrected
ambari server upgrades are well documented on the hdp site and in my experience have not caused any issues
unless you can somehow mount your hdfs so it looks like local disk to your os it won t work
it seems the error because of missing or invalid dns entries
try using like below example xmx is sample option you can gradually increase and see what is best value of memory allocation based on your number of agents running parllely
if each store data is dependent on previous store then you can use exec command after each store
the error is due to the resource allocation policy use by yarn
when you disk is full it causes your node to become unhealthy which reduces the memory
it was a strange error because it appeared from one day to another without making any changes
i spent about a week to find out what causes unsatisfiedlinkerror
i think the main reason is that java cannot find its dependencies
it will show many properties including java library path comment out below code also comment out below code by doing this nutch opts will not contain djava library path so java will use original setting
so we solved the problem
our script specifies the path to libraries like so pig couldn t find the libraries because path to mnt was invalid for one of the nodes
one potential reason is that when starting up nifi it will unpack the nars into the work directory
this should force the changes to take effect
in the code below the join will duplicate rows first because all matching material id will be joined then row number function will assign 1 to rows where a location id b location id and 2 to rows where a location id b location id if exist also rows where a location id b location id and 1 if there are not exist such
b location id added to the order by in the row number function so it will prefer rows with lower b location id in case there are no exact matching
first we create another table to calculate averages from the table b based on material id over all
second in the join table we create three columns c1 the value where material id and location id are matching result from a left join of table a with table b
but using a combiner we could perform a pre reduce in the mapper so the output of the mapper will be in this simple example by using a combiner you reduced the total number of key value pairs from 5 to 3 which will give you less network traffic and better performance in the shuffle phase
with saveastable the default location that spark saves to is controlled by the hivemetastore based on the docs
this can be caused by all kinds of things like running hive queries or pig other mapreduce jobs taking up all capacity
because you re going to add your node using parcels and provoque conflicts between rpms and parcels
the error is because sqoop can t find hive
if you have code like this then df will have 400000 partitions afterwards which makes the following actions inefficient because you have 1 tasks for each partition
there are a couple of native libraries that come with hadoop and that depend on other libraries in the os
some of that dependencies are not met because hadoop you ve downloaded was built on a different system
i found that this is happening as there were multiple other instances of spark shell already running and holding derby db already so when i was starting yet another spark shell and creating data frame on it using rdd todf it was throwing error solution i ran the ps command to find other instances of spark shell ps ef grep spark shell and i killed them all using kill command kill 9 spark shell processid example kill 9 4848 after all the spark shell instances were gone i started a new spark shell and reran my data frame function and it ran just fine
for me it turned out to be due to some files in one of the source directories being still open
it is extracting the record based on balancing of curly braces and
yes it is possible to create project model cube with the rest api because kylin web is communicating with backend through the rest api
this job will be divided in to multiple stages based on shuffle boundaries
each stage will be further divided in to multiple tasks based on partitions
now tasks will be executed based on available executors core node
hence the default location to install the sharelib is user oozie share lib
looks like based on your error hdfs client is unable to reach namenode for some reason which could be firewall or config issue
for instance spark submit files keystore jks truststore jks can be used in spark scala as other posts on so i don t have the links handy suggested to use org apache spark sparkfiles get keystore jks and use that location in the option kafka ssl truststore location but that still resulted in fnfe
if we run on a cluster and using one connection it won t work because connection can t be sent to each node it is not serializable and we can t create a connection for each element of an rdd
so the solution is using saveasnewapihadoopdataset which can create a connection for each node of the cluster and save all elements of the rdd to hbase or hdfs depends on the configuration
you can add new rules to your security group by applying the procedures given at http docs aws amazon com awsec2 latest userguide using network security html adding security group rule and adding inbound traffic for port 9000 you don t need to do anything for outbound because security groups are stateful
or in case you want to read from the beginning of a sequence file to a specific length however it is not possible to set the start to the middle of a sequence file because you will skip the header of the sequence file and you will get not a sequence file error thus you must set the start parameter to the beginning of the sequence file
therefore the solution is to create your file split in your inputformat as usual and you create the sequence reader in your recordreader as usual no need to specify start or length the idea is here in sync which skips the amount of bytes specified by start of the split
when you try to access tokens 6 you go beyond the size of the array so you get an arrayindexoutofboundsexception
in that case you can also use a combiner to speed up the process as a wordcount program would do
carrier delay is 2nd field so you need to access using token 1 since the array index start with 0
token 6 is giving error since you have total 6 columns
thanks to blue data support i finally got the working solution it was a bdfs specific error connected to data taps usage dtap protocol
the issue is because a doesn s exists in the d relation schema
after changing the property s value you must restart the nodemanager in order for it to have an effect
now that is something we may not want to happen considering the case where each process will end up starving for resources and might lead to worse performance
the 5th user will be send to waiting because each user cannot be given 20gb each because we have set the limit as 25 of 100gb which is 25gb
i can suggest the following reason for such big difference in table size
using spark application you will not use a compression codec for hfile because it specifies it after file creation
set hive auto convert join false fixed the issue in my case
typically a mix of both the budgeting co t and project management sliding time scales nightmares additional costs new technology also means new skills to learn new training costs new delays for the team to re shape and re adjust and grow into a mature using of the new technology at performance levels better than the currently used tools etc etc risks of choosing a popular brand which on the other side does not exhibit any superficial powers the marketing texts were promising but once having paid the initial costs of entry there is no other way than to bear the risk of never achieving the intended target possibly due to overestimated performance benefits underestimated costs of transformation heavily underestimated costs of operations maintenance what would you say if you could use a solution where better options remain your options you can start now with the code you are currently using without a single line of code changed you can start now with a still your free will based gradual path of performance scaling you can avoid all risks of mis investing into any extra premium costs super box but rather stay on the safe side re use a cheap and massively in service tested fine tuned deployment proven cots hardware units a common dual cpu a few gb machines commonly used in large thousands in datacentres you can scale up to any level of performance you need growing cpu bound processing performance gradually from start hassle free up to some 1k 2k 4k 8k cpus as needed yes up to many thousands of cpus that your current workers code can immediately use for delivering the immediate benefit of the such increased performance and thus leave your teams free hands and more time for thorough work on possible design improvements and code re factoring for even better performance envelopes if the current workflow having been passively just smart distributed to say 1000 later 2000 or 5000 cpu cores still without a single sloc changed do not suffice on its own
you need to change new org apache hadoop mrunit mapreduce mapdriver to new org apache hadoop mrunit mapreduce mapdriver longwritable text text intwritable you need to add the generic types so that it knows how to run the mapper
here s my answer based on my above collection of comments
while i don t have the specs in front of me since it s been a few months i found impala to generally perform well with i believe it was 16gb on tens of billions of records dozens hundreds of tb uncompressed each about 70 columns wide working on one or two queries concurrently in parquet format 1gb each gz compressed file
the data task nodes were 17 ec2 i3 2xlarge because of their great performance and value re nvmes aggressively priced
one note i didn t make in my comments is that you may be able to oversubscribe the memory so that you can maximize performance of each tool by using the cluster s resources fully
here you create a local conda environment upload it to hdfs and have yarn distribute it to workers so you do not need sudo access
note that there are a lot of parameters that you can pass so you are encouraged to read the usage and troubleshooting parts of the docs
specific answers to questions 1 client mynamenode 50070 hadoop does not know anything about dask there is no reason that a namenode server should know what to do with a dask client connection 2 no module named lib this is very strange and perhaps aa bug that should be logged by itself
since this file contains clear text so another way is to just export hadoop credstore password password
you don t need to group by any column since you are looking to get a total of all the frequencies for the denominator
the reason is that i have several directories listed in the dfs datanode data dir parameter of hdfs
this was giving me problems because in the first group of machines had 4 hdfs directories assigned to 3 partitions of 1 8t each thus only one of them was considered twice while the second group had 4 hdfs directories assigned to 1 partition of 5 4tb which was thus multiplied by 4
ultimately the problem is the results of a heterogeneous partition configuration of the machines some low level detail of hdfs not properly documented
could this be due to the cloudera manager
it should give you the expected result
as per javadoc the reducer s reduce method is having below signature according to it reducer should be the issue was that because of slight difference in the signature of map and reduce method the methods were not actually getting overriden
but if you use scala file system api in hdfs it causes issue because scala cannot understood the hdfs features like replication data blocks partitions
then the input to your reducer would be in format of text text but you had specified the input to reducer as text intwritable so it is throwing the error
you get this error when the filesystem is not configured which probably needs to be done at both the hiveserver and your local client s core site xml files just because the jars exist doesn t mean they are loaded onto the classpath and configured to read from your azure account
when a request is send to my local container sparkui automatically redirects the request to hadoop master is how yarn works because it see that the request is not coming from hadoop master and it only accepts requests from this source
when master receives the forwarded request it tries to send it to spark driver my local docker container which forward again the request to hadoop master because it see that the ip source is not the master is the proxy ip
this means that administrators can set kerberos policy so that tickets must be renewed at relatively short intervals every day for example
so renew until is part of the ticket and it s max value is limited on server side for security reasons
whenever you are sure your algorithms are correct automatic hard disk volumes partioning or fragmentation problems may occur somewhere after that 75gb threshold as of you are probably using the same filesystem for caching the results
even if it gives a good result for table extraction relation it can be from the raw data
there is a change from 3 x in default ports https issues apache org jira browse hdfs 9427 that may cause issues
the code is right since i see this error possible column names are blahblahblah can you check if asset model id and engine type id are present in both the tables a am am egt you are joining with
may be the naming is different due to which it is throwing an error
there was a similar use case where i was trying to do the same but realised sparksession or sparkcontext is not serializable thus cannot be accessed from executors
here data is stored and retrieved in columns and hence can read only relevant data if only some data is required
well when you are doing a ranged search only the cells whose timestamp is in that range are returned so you may end up with a row with missing cells
writing the below answer assuming that table was created using hive and read using spark since the question is tagged with apache spark sql how was the data created
when we create a hive table on top of the data created from spark hive will be able to read it right since it is not cased sensitive
the default value of the property is infer and save since spark 2 2 0
i encountered the same issue cause i ran out of space or exceeded the number of files on dbfs so i figured i d just mount my own storage account on azure and encountered the same issue you did
i spun up my own instance of databricks and was able to successfully mount my own storage but running the same code on the community edition resulted in an error
thus i went for the write parquet hdfs tmp loc locally on the cluster and then processed to use the aws s3 dist cp from the hdfs to the s3 folder
it seems like it was coming from adobe acrobat document because when i tried to open it locally the print pop up showed up as well
since you are using udaf so you have to use group by
a safer way to link to sources would be to define another java project which would link to hive sources and compile them then declare your hadoopdb as depending on the hive project
mappers should be able to work independent and w o side effects
the input is the list of strings and we can arrange things so that each mapper gets one string only
sequencefile or a tmp hbase table and then write a final mr job that takes that location as an input and merges the results
this can and should be done locally or at least let each machine map to a symlink based on some locally identified configuration e g
set an environment variable a la hadoop home based on the local machine s hostname and let various scripts work with this
if you set parallelism of order to 1 you can just do auto increment yourself in a udf of course that would have the potentially undesired effect of only using 1 reducer to do your sorting
also i am not sure how you got your example output the input seems to be already ordered so item1 should have id 1 and item 2 should have id 2 right
assuming you assign it a decent memory footprint gb s there is no reason you can t have a cluster that holds petabytes of data in hdfs storage assuming you have enough physical storage
a sequencefile is a flat file consisting of binary key value pairs hence extensively used in mapreduce as input output formats
when you have large binary files use sequencefile format as the input format and set the mapred input split size accordingly
you can set the number of mappers based on the total input size and the split size you had set
the reason was that when using 001 character sequence or other unicode characters during the object serialization it was getting transformed to some invalid formats
in most case this will lead to performance trouble
result of outer join in hive is sometimes wrong
since the namenode is basically just a rpc server managing a hashmap with the blocks you have two major memory problems java hashmap is quite costly its collision resolution seperate chaining algorithm is costly as well because it stores the collided elements in a linked list
so these are the reasons why your namenode needs so much memory
i haven t benchmarked it yet so i can t give you very good tips on that
depending on how you submit your jobs you have to fine tune the other property as well
of course you should give the namenode always enough memory so it has headroom to not fall into full garbage collection cycles
store keys with large values megabyes in a loop so that you run out of diskspace mismatch hadoop version with the one shipped in set allowed number of opened files on the os to a very low number set jvm memory parameters to very low values just enough to start hbase and overload it with queries set jvm memory parameters to very high values to cause intensive swapping close ports or hard reboot nodes soft reboot nodes some things i can think of
try this adding this to your cli job run d mapred reduce tasks 0 this should set the number of reducers to 0 which in effect will have the mappers dump output directly to hdfs
then you just add a final query with a last join summarizing all the previous results
i think the issue may be a really big amount of data streamed because of the so many joins
the documentation should be updated to cover that since the basic example shows exactly 2 servers being configured
the pig s loadfunc sits on the top of the hadoop s inputformat so you can define which inputformat your loadfunc will use
some remarks on the custom inputformat i d create a custom inputformat in which the recordreader is a modified version of org apache hadoop mapreduce lib input linerecordreader most of the methods would remain the same except initialize it would call a custom linereader based on org apache hadoop util linereader
since this hasn t been updated in the recent past i d also suggest you to have a look the source code if something is unclear happens
this is the only reason
i have the same error because my workmate changed mysql password without a word
because you have a defined folder structure that doesn t have variable depth i think it s as simple as passing the following pattern as your input path you probably don t need to create your own udf for this the pigloader should be able to handle them assuming they are in some delimited format the above example assumes 3 fields tab delimited
so if your bloack size is 128mb then you ll see the file size as 128mb when the first block is done then after some time you ll see the size as 256mb and so on until the entire file is copied so you can use the regular hdfs ui or command line hadoop fs ls to monitor block by block copy progress
run a map reduce job where each mapper will be responsible for transferring 1 slice
as far as the load on the cassandra cluster i am not certain since i have not used the cassandra connector with sqoop personally but if you wish to extract data you will need to put some load on your cluster anyway
you could for example do it once a day at a certain time where the traffic is lowest so that in case your cassandra availability drops the impact is minimal
i m also thinking that if this is related to your other question you might want to consider exporting to hive instead of mysql in which case sqoop works too because it can export to hive directly
this may be one of the main reason not to use cassandra at least for me
i have found the solution the data nodes in the slave machines dint start because the location of hadoop home in my master and slaves were different
since you haven t defined any load function pig will use pigstorage in which the default delimiter is t
but due to incompatible new versions of eclipse and eclipse hadoop plugin i refused to use it because seems to me that using this plugin doesn t have any good benefits
i was facing the same problem i thinks the problem because there is no folder or files in the hdfs i solved with these steps hadoop dfs mkdir name of folder hadoop fs ls
extract relevant information from them using hive that is going to be a bit tricky since hive doesn t really do well with xml files
specifically i added this property into yarn site xml property name yarn resourcemanager hostname name value master value property reason the default value in yarn default xml is 0 0 0 0 and many properties use this hostname to contact resource manager such as property name yarn resourcemanager address name value yarn resourcemanager hostname 8032 value property
i am not good in python hence here is the example in ruby mapper rb
it looks like you are using amazon s string manipulation and datetime functions for pig since extract isn t a built in function
there is no way to get access to the context and as a result the counters in the partitioner
well i don t know whether this will work at runtime but you can just manually list the hadoop jars via the jar option rather than via hadoop if you look at the addtowar sh script which is where this error message originates you can see a set of conditional jars to include based upon the version of hadoop specified via the hadoop option so seeing as 1 0 x isn t in the list you can look at the 0 20 104 or 0 20 200 version and just use the same jars from 1 0 3 hadoop core 1 0 3 lib jackson core asl 1 8 8 jar lib jackson mapper asl 1 8 8 jar lib commons configuration 1 6 jar i don t see why it won t work oozie just needs to communicate with the mapred and hdfs services but you may have issues at runtime worth a try i have tried this with 3 1 3 incubating and didn t have any problems with the small amount of testing i did
another possible reason could be previous cluster crash with some hdfs data corrupted
sys argv contains the list of parameters and since you did not give any there was a index out of range error
i think you want something in between since you want to run subsequent code after the submit but before the complete
what you would need to do is eliminate all direct and indirect references to the jobcontext class from your source code replace all variables of type jobcontext with object replace all calls to methods and constructors that take jobcontext as a parameter or return it as a result with reflective method or constructor calls using a class for jobcontext that you obtained using class forname
in short if you can get rid of all places where your code uses or depends on a statically loaded jobcontext then you won t get any incompatibleclasschangeerror exceptions for that class
if your using sqoop 1 4 2 assuming based on ojdbc6 jar above then see comments about the driver usage from kathleen here as it shouldn t be required https issues apache org jira browse sqoop 457 with sqoop 1 4 2 and dropping ojdbc6 jar into my sqoop lib this string works w hdp 1 3 and mapr 2 0 if you have access to mysql and or sql server etc

if you read the months tostring it returns p string valueof getvalue m so you can not use this value and want to convert it to a int
when you want to process all the files in a directory you can just specify the path of the directory as your input file to your hadoop job so that it will consider all the files in that directory as its input
i found a hacked solution which worked for me but i m not happy with it because it s not really practicable
my hacked soultion doesn t work in this case because pig creats the jobs automaticly
you can t do that assignment because java lang object extended by java io inputstream extended by java io filterinputstream extended by java io datainputstream extended by org apache hadoop fs fsdatainputstream fsdatainputstream is not a fileinputstream
the error itself occurs because the jvm cannot find the class you requested
see this other so question for more details
that is most likely due to your java version not matching with the jar
issue i noticed while running select queries on hive on external tables which have locations that files were streamed into it i get encounter such errors as java io filenotfoundexception file does not exist hdfs hmaster 9000 data etl sdp statistics ppasinterface some path to a partition some files tmp examining the flume log file showed a rename of the some file tmp to some file was the reason for failure

this conf although might be redundant worked for me on macos after a painful sunday morning you will need to do the required changes depending on your machine install and os but at least you have a clue
check out greenplum we have 2 types of big data solutions 1 is based on hadoop which supports data storage at pb levels 2 is based on greenplum for real time data analysis on smaller data scale
however in my experience there are a few rough edges due to the fact that the windows java utilities expect to have been called with windows style arguments pathnames classpaths etcetera
since this is homework i won t give you the full answer but i would suggest that you look carefully at your outputschema and review this thread
for me the error was due to the python script dying during execution
similar to your problem my script seemed to work just fine for a small subset of the problem but just wouldn t work on hadoop for the entire dataset and that was due to flawed input
also you can go to the job tracker and see the exact error that caused hadoop to stop execution
the job tracker can usually be found at http localhost 50030 jobtracker jsp also change usr bin env to usr bin python this was because the machine running your script does not know what to do with it
it would probably just cause your computer to freeze up as well if you ran it with firstlettermapper py instead of python firstlettermapper py
third your shabang would just run env on the file you should change it to usr bin python or usr bin env python that s probably what s causing env to give a non zero exit value and therefore your mapper which ran for 30 seconds retries with attempt 2 about 10 minutes later
from the exception trace it appears that your trying to invoke a method on a null object from the source code the following comparison fails line buf 2 is not being populated and hence the null pointer exception
your project should never have to depend on hadoop client as spark already does
due to network configuration issues
therefore you ll need to create a symlink directing cygwin to
you cannot use drive letters in paths so instead of use make sure you do this for your hadoop temp directory as well
caused by java lang outofmemoryerror gc overhead limit exceeded means that you will have to adjust the memory settings of your mapred child for example in hadoop conf mapred site xml or better yet in the configuration of your job
i m not sure how string comparisons is implemented in pig but it may be worthwhile to try something like by sorting the names so that the smaller always appears first both john paul and paul john should now be in the same order making the distinct eliminate one
however this approach all depends on how the string comparison is implemented
naturally they can t talk to each other in that state
using hadoop streaming stdout is the stream dedicated to pass key values between mappers reducers and to output results so you should not log anything in it
if you are referring to storing task results in a specific backend there s support for multiple databases protocols sql and nosql
i believe there s no specific advantage or disadvantage between storing the results either in sql mysql posgtgres or nosql mongo couchdb but that s just my personal opinion and that depends on what type of application you are running
the problem is with the system out println you will not get the result in the console
import classes needed for logging import org apache commons logging log import org apache commons logging logfactory define the logger private static final log log logfactory getlog myclass class log all what you need log info filename you will get the results during the job execution in the console
you still call tostring on it instead it next so you should change into don t make it inst decode it next tostring because it would call it next two times in one while iteration
after that don t call string blah it next tostring because you will get java util nosuchelementexception iterate past last value same reason as above
the job finishes sometimes successfully because when you have one reducer and that reduce task by chance is sent to a working node manager then it becomes successful job

update further discussion on the mailing list from jarek based on the pointer from jark the following did the trick let us take a look at the results and looks like the scripts i was seeking are there for the taking that s what i was looking for
after you get everything right in the transformation it depends on how you move the output to the final location
update apparently hive currently automatically normalizes line endings which means you either hit a bug of hive you use a non stable build of hive or your output contains actual stuff that causes the null records to appear
it may depend on localization settings but i don t know enough of hive to proof that
i replaced what i used to have for output with this basically the key i was using and the key to the put statement were slightly different which cause the reducer to receive put statements out of order
first you need set user password for make changes in db structure then you should change stmt executequery by stmt execute because the create table query will throws an exception for not return results
i had added the following without actually adding the id field in the outgoing mapwritable this caused es to throw the exception
so as you have given mapred framework service as yarn so framework will run resourcemanager
you may have already figured this out or may otherwise not need the answer but comparing my issue to yours helped me figure out what was wrong so i thought i d share in case anyone else had the same question
there appear to be a couple of problems the first of which is that normally when things are run under hadoop jar hadoop imbues the various system environment variables and classpaths etc into the program being run in your case since oryx runs without using hadoop jar instead using something like then hadoop conf dir doesn t actually make it into the environment so system getenv in oryxconfiguration java fails to pick it up and uses the default etc hadoop conf value
this is solved simply with the export command which you can test by seeing if it makes it into a subshell the second and more unfortunate issue is that oryx appears to hard code hdfs rather allowing any filesystem scheme set by the user it all depends on whether oryx intends to add support for other filesystem schemes in the future but in the meantime you would either have to change the oryx code yourself and recompile or you could attempt to hack around it but with potential for pieces of oryx which have a hard dependency on hdfs to fail
the most reliable solution in your case would be to deploy with default fs hdfs where bdutil will still install the gcs connector so that you can run hadoop distcp to move your data from gcs to hdfs temporarily run oryx and then once finished copy it back out into gcs
can you change the datatype to charrarray or bytearray so that concat will work
a key difference however is that bdutil will also include and configure the gcs connector for hadoop so that your mapreduce can operate directly against the data in gcs rather than needing to copy it into hdfs first
the classes from the jar will already be available to the udf since you have registered that with the pig script
finally i got the cause of this issue actually i have been using the combinefileinputformat with gzip so the first runnning job was extracting the gzip file in the same folder and was deleting it on its completion however when i ran another job in parallel it also takes the file unzipped by the firstjob in its input
so in between the execution of the second job the unzipped file was getting deleted by the first job this actually was causing error
because if you use select all command that job will not enter into mapreduce phase
if you select any specific column it will enter into mapreduce phase so you may get this error
please check your mapreduce logs and see if you can find something which is causing this
this was a bug that has been fixed on latest master branch 0 8 https issues apache org jira browse drill 1871 my testing confirms that things work ok still seeing issues but get some results back
you probably need to remove the hadoop core dependency because you also have hadoop hdfs even if not directly
it looks like your hadoop cluster is not configured properly that is the reason you are getting the connection refunded error
hence changing the above command from ls to ls hdfs resolves my problem
i was getting this issue because i was initializing the registry like so when i changed it to that got me passed the exception
even if you use sqoop 1 4 6 the result is still same
this class allows the map reduce framework to partition the map outputs based on certain key fields not the whole keys
the reason it worked in hivecli but not beeline is because there is no user group security enforced in hivecli where as beeline will adhere to some form of authorisation sentry ranger if installed or hdfs level permissions
your problem is that your writes are getting batched automatically and they re flushed at the end of the job when the table is closed probably causing every put operation to have exactly the same timestamp and they re basically overwriting themselves writing a version with the same timestamp of another one overwrites that version instead of inserting a new one
the first approach to solve the issue could be to provide the timestamp by yourself with put hput new put l 0 getbytes system currenttimemillis but you will probably face the same issue because the operation is so fast that a lot of puts will have the same timestamp
2 modify the mapper to write to the context all the values of each row so they get grouped into an iterable and passed to the reducer i e abc xyz kkk qwe asd anf rrb 3 implement my own reducer to work somewhat like this pseudocode that way there will be always 1ms between each version the only thing you ve got to be careful is that if you got a huge number of versions and run the same job multiple times the timestamps of the new job could overlap the timestamps of a previous one if you expect less than 30k versions you shouldn t be worried about it because each job will be at least 30 seconds away from the next one
pablo yesterday the namenode of the cosmos instance entered in safe mode due to the hdd was running out of space
records do not have to be local to the mapper it s just more preferable for performance reasons
your understanding is correct expect that the mappers run on the splits derived from blocks rather than complete block
your datanode is not able to connect to namenode that is the reason for your datanode not being reflected namenode web ui
for some reason that cmake doesn t recognize visual studio
this will cause the jars to be copied to the workers each time the application is started
this may be because you use
there are a bunch of possible problems with your code which i will try and highlight but it is unclear which of them might be the cause of the problem
this is the first thing i would change if you then start seeing an error message this will give you a pointer to the actual cause of the issue
to work with rdf data on hadoop you need to use the apache jena elephas libraries which you appear to be doing in at least part of your code and the triplewritable type instead so it is unclear why hadoop even lets your code compile run
if you are storing tweets with identical id it is because you are receiving the data with those ids or you are interpreting the data in the wrong way
since local task runs on am
note however that this might lead to unexpected behaviors for some jobs and you will probably have to play with mapreduce map memory mb and mapreduce map java opts as well as mapreduce reduce memory mb and mapreduce reduce java opts in the mapred site config file in order to make sure that jobs remain stable
in this case the input key is longwritable and hence the inputsampler would create a partition based on a sub set of all longwritable key s
but the output key is text hence the mr framework will fail to find a suitable bucket from with in the partition
i was getting the same wrong key class error in my case it was because i was using combiner with custom writable
replacing server server1 by server 1 and accordingly modifying myid file for each node did the trick
in my case problem is about zookeeper locations configuration is not same for each node so zookeeper can not provide quorum and mentioned nodes can not be part of cluster
in second issue in server server1 machine port1 port2 since server1 is not a long so numberformatexception will be thrown by org apache zookeeper server quorum quorumpeerconfig parseproperties method
simply because there is no block to recover
when you are loading data you need to mention the details of the partition based on the column value
first bring down your hadoop cluster using stop yarn sh and stop dfs sh in that order
running a simple cat or wc l on the file would cause the terminal to hang
infact these days json is being used vastly due to its size features compared to xml
reason the cause is that hive treats count value and count value in this query as two different aggregate expression when compiling query and generating plan
based on your sqoop command i am guessing that creation date column is present in your sqlserver table
there are still permissions in place on hdfs you can see that with hdfs hdfs rw r r in your message above so you need to assert yourself to be a user who has the necessary permissions for your operation which is what you did with system setproperty hadoop user name hdfs the short version is identity is not the same as authentication
or you can probably just run this algorithm on a local machine with two input files because this is just o n and even 9 gb of data is very doable
the important thing is to inform customers of inherent tradeoffs in performance and reliability and at the same time to encourage them to think of current configuration as the right architecture for scalability going forward should they be satisfied with functionality and overall results on a smaller scale
there was some data loss involved due to ungraceful shutdown but it was limited in scope

p s i have deleted the directory pointed out by dfs datanode data dir and it has erased all data on hdfs but helped me to fix the issue so you can use an alternate way if has any for fixing this issue
it then waits for datanodes to report their blocks so that it does not prematurely start replicating the blocks though enough replicas already exist in the cluster
if that s the cause then install java and hadoop on a different folder without spaces in the path
this is a soft link that link to etc hadoop conf i run after run it it removes etc hadoop conf however reinstall does not recreate it so you may have to create all conf files by yourself
the first problem some conf files point to the etc conf directory same as they are supposed to however etc conf points back to the other conf directory which leads to an endless loop
this leads to exact your error message
sometimes it happens due to the load on mysql server
under the hood oozie stores the content in xml files so you can edit your workflows and jobs also in xml
since only partial data is written on problematic datanode we have to remove this block of data completely
node failure can be caused just by a disk failure so every disk failure will cause a node failure which means that the data will be lost if you have a single disk and single node
in this case disk failure will not cause a node failure necessarily
op string values since they are interpretable as ints were converted as such
therefore when you require your input value to be a longwritable you get this exception
consider using appropriate compression while storing mapper results use optimum number of block replication
in general the most likely explanations for an oome are that you have run out of memory because your code has a memory leak or you do not enough memory for what you are trying to do the way you are trying to do it
however in all likelihood you are close to running out and that has caused the gc cpu utilization to spike exceeding the gc overhead threshold
the inference is therefore that you have told hadoop to load more data than is going to fit in memory at one time
change your application so that the job streams the data from the file or from hfs themselves rather than loading a csv into a map
if you have chosen to install mapreduce version 1 then you should replace the job addcachefile command with distributeddcache addcachefile and change the setup method accordingly call it configure
so if your field is of type timestamp called some time you could query as if you re stuck with a string that s stored as a valid timestamp value then you ll have to do more work perhaps the second option displays the value as desired and orders by a number a unix timestamp is just a number but it has the same order as the date so no need to cast that further to an actual date
set memory parameters depending on your input data set size
special thanks to srini samudrala for working with me on this
it is the associated spark context for your streaming context so no need to create a new spark context for that matter
since scope of this jar is cross check the hbase version of this jar in your cluster
but due to the overhead of copying table the performance slows down a little
junit can be debugged from eclipse ide since its a java class
you are saying that the bandwidth is over utilized during the data transfer or the dns were not balanced after putting the data because balancer is used to balance the amount of data present on nodes in the cluster
the result of this will be that spark gets all these physical records as one logical record
whichever you choose depends on your use case
since you are using hadoop v2 you ll want to set the hadoop prefix or the matlab hadoop install environment variable instead of the hadoop home environment variable
you can redirect the output of ffmpeg to a pipe and use hadoop fs put user to read the input from stdin like this note that you will need f format option since ffmpeg can not guess the output format from the file extension since we use our pipe

as yuval itzchakov already mentioned the information about k and v is missing furthermore i observe following you are missing return value in your method even if you would return your val hbaserdd the code would still not compile because expected return value is of type rdd k v but val hbaserdd is of type rdd org apache hadoop hbase io immutablebyteswritable org apache hadoop hbase client result with this and couple of assumptions in mind a working code sample could look like this
the difference between the two is that the comaprable interface requires you to implement a compareto method so that mapreduce is able to sort and group the keys correctly
since it is looking for master you have two choices either edit the file or try going to your spark config directory maybe opt spark conf and edit spark defaults conf

although it s been a while since i asked this question i worked out a solution to the issue myself which i thought i d share with others
datfil and datfix shockingly there isn t any mention of these issues in neither the official azure documentation nor did i find anything on the web
it basically due to jar issue only
you are seeing the effect of 1478649561 an integral type being approximated in floating point representation to fit into the 32 bit java float type

it sends a raw ntlm token to your jgss backed server which rejects the token because this is not a spnego wrapped token but a raw ntlm token java does not support ntlm here is sample code how to intercept this and respond with a meaningful message
moreover your curl version 7 19 7 on linux is extremely old and unsecure you should upgrade immediately and the spnego authenticator on jetty is broken because it does not respond with a context completion token
to sum up the entire authentication should not be trusted because it is faulty
going forward it doesn t hurt to keep that file in place now that you have it there
according to your description based on my understanding i think you want to read data from azure blob storage with spark but the fs defaultfs setting for hadoop configuration was set for your maincontainer when you created the hdinsight instance
i put a variable initialization in that method guessing init is only to be done once
if you have one task that run for 3 minutes while the others run for less than a second your distributed computation is not balanced and therefore you cannot take advantage of having multiple machines running altogether because the computationnal time is constrained by your longest task
that behaviour is often caused by inputs of unbalanced sizes 7 files of 1 ko and 1 file of 1 go of by an unbalanced operation transformation join
finally its very hard to explain your timing vs cpu without knowing exactly what is your job but a potential explanation is that you have a data intensive job and not cpu intensive jobs and therefore the bottleneck is the hard drive ssd on the machine with slowest cpu
but because i start from only 1 network when i do the data gets parallelized only on one cpu in one task because the rdd contains only 1 element hence the problem
the namenode will return the address of datanode to client when using client upload so you should ensure your client will get to the address

you should include all configuration files in that hadoop configuration directory not only the core site xml and hdfs site xml files
in my main program i ve a build gradle like this then i created another gradle package which has following build gradle the root cause is due the hbase is referencing proto2 and my program is using proto3 thus causing this nosuchmethoderror error
because of this it will be calling the default implementation since you aren t overriding the map method
which results in the same input key value types coming in being emitted thus they key is a longwritable
what hadoop is doing is trying to find that directory inside home directory of the hadoop user so you can create home directory of hadoop user with which you are running hadoop commands as i am assuming finn is the username then you apply you will see that access logs txt should be copied

hence simply pass a string echo instead of file contents cat however why do you pass arguments via pipes
it should work fine if you replace this line with this line the reason you are getting an exception when you check for len 0 is that your string is not split into any sub parts so len is 1

after adding this parameters in jdbc connector you should be able to run hive interpreter with in my case it was a little trickier because i used cloudera hadoop so the standard jdbc hive connector was not working
the error seems to be because you have count inside the sum statement
this results in the data as follows
the above dataset will allow you to categorise the sum of transaction amounts based on the transaction age as you want
the trick is to have the above query in a sub query and use the results of this subquery to categorize
this results in the categorised output as below which gives you the count of transactions and sum of transaction amounts for each category for each merchant now this is our dataset which is more or less the final result
below is the query which calculates this and based on the criteria it marks the flag as true or false indicating whether or not we are interested in that merchant or not
we just need to join these two tables and then based on the has distinct cards gt 1 display the columns accordingly from the dataset generated previously

i d suggest creating one dataframe for all the files inside your directory and then using a pivot to re shape the data accordingly you can write it as a csv using dataframewriter the hard part with this would be creating a different dataframe for each file with an extra column for the filename from which the dataframe is created
what you re doing vs what you seem to be wanting or if the files are in hdfs it s not clear how you have put files into it but hdfs definitely doesn t have a home folder or a desktop so the second error at least makes sense
please check the file s owner in hdfs directory i met this issue because the owner is root it got solved when i changed it to your user
the problem occurs mostly due to hive site xml
since spark 2 0 you should use sparksession which involves both sparkcontext and sqlcontext
after days of debugging i realised another dependency in my pom was causing this error
better use term overwrite instead of truncate because it is what exactly happening during insert overwrite
because the partition to overwrite is unknown partition should be taken from dataset and the dataset is empty nothing to overwrite then
while starting hbase master daemon i ve got the same error i ve guess that the error happens because hbase master use jars from hadoop home and can t find there htrace core library
thay may happen because you have two versions of htrace core 3 1 0 and 4 2 0 you should remove 4 2 0
i ever got this error that s because by default hive tries to execute operations as the calling user i add below lines to hive config file conf hive site xml to ask hive to execute operations as the hiveserver2 process user then get rid of this error here is the document
can you set the java home in hadoop env cmd as java path is different for each system depending upon 32bit 64bit
also can try below way sometimes even we set the right path in hadoop env cmd still returns the same error so we have to follow below steps open cmd command prompt as a administrator
if your jdk folder like c program files java jdk 1 8 261 file path contain space so you should move your jdk to the folder that folder name does not contain spaces
make sure that your path is between quotation marks i had the same problem cause i forget the to close the quotation mark
in yarn cluster mode the default output console is not really your driver where you submit your job but the yarn logs it self so you can run and after then you can use pattern where pattern is a word or expression that you have in your print command in inside your python script
if you want the 1000 fields in the file they will have to be in the dataframe so you would have to fill the missing values with nulls or some other value
if you want the dataframe with the full schema you have to follow these extra steps pivot the result to generate one only row for each id and a column for each key in the doc with its corresponding value pivoted df df groupby id pivot key agg f first value this dataframe has all the fields present in the data
mapoutputvalue should implement writable so that it can be serialised between tasks in the mapreduce job
because if the same uids exist in many different days then count distinct uid on day one count distinct uid on day two does not equal to count distinct uid calculated on these two days
but probably you can do some close estimation based on sketching algorithm if the estimation is applicable
one of the reason would be if you re using multiple jars passing to spark submit and it contains the same class that your udf is using then the issue might occur
cloudera data platform is integrated with cloudera dataflow which on based on apache nifi so integration should not be a concern
depends on what traffic you are expecting but i would consider nifi a standalone service such as kafka zookeeper so a cluster of 3 would be a great start and maybe increasing if needed
that depends on how you configure it
someone on the apache hive mailing list suggested this was being caused by the yarn container writing its results files to the local machine where it was running instead of hdfs
i did some digging in the source code and found that which is the default in hadoop 3 2 1 was causing the problem
hive gives count result from metastore instead of running a count job to optimise performance
try msck repair on this table first to let hive know about new external files and modify hive metastore accordingly
try invoking beeline tez engine as below and then run your query if above doesn t work then try to fix any issue in sql
normally with java based mapreduce programs this works as intended since you ll end up with similar environment variables and classpath between the driver code that runs under the hadoop jar command and the executor code that runs on worker nodes in yarn containers
hadoop streaming is a bit of an oddball since it s not as much of a first class citizen in normal hadoop usage
this is an unfortunate consequence of some legacy compatibility considerations in dataproc
you get that error because you re trying to read hive acid table but spark still doesn t have support for this
after some further research i see that hadoop 2 x overrides the classpath so the solution is to create an uberjar and pass that to hadoop
there are many different unicode properties and also differences between regex flavors so i d recommend investigating this link for reference
besides that w has the same meaning as 0 9a z a z and w returns all characters not matched by w so you can replace that part of the expression i e
last line in the stacktrace caused by java lang illegalargumentexception java net urisyntaxexception relative path in absolute uri file src main resources warehouse hints that the proper way to set spark sql warehouse dir is to supply an absolute path for metastore directory something like file project root dir src main resources warehouse
first download these cmds and paste them in bin folder which you might have already done https github com hadifadl hive cmd no need to repeat it if you have already done it i have created the database in mysql by create database metastore db my hive site xml looks like this because i choosed to use mysql write your mysql username password in place of root root
you can do that by stopping the yarn and hdfs daemons at first then enabling only the hdfs daemon then formatting everything on the namenode aka the hdfs in your system not your local files of course and enabling yarn and hdfs daemons at last remember to re run the hdfs dfs df h command after deleting stuff in the hdfs so you make sure you have free space on the hdfs
for project you describe you should look at solr since it abstracts out lots of the issues of scalability etc
that is when row m is inserted into table 1 in table 2 against column 1 which is the row key of table 2 i would save its summation or other aggregational results be it average standard deviation max min etc
link helped me understand possible cause of failure
set your pig classpath to point to your correct hadoop home installation so that pig can pick up ur cluster information from core site xml mapreduce site xml and hdfs site xml better to follow the link for correct installation
if you can order files before processing for example using os sort utility or a mapreduce job with a single reducer you can read two files simultaneously do your processing and output result without keeping too much data in memory
just open an inputstream reader for the file then in a loop read in one piece of your data process the piece of data store the result in memory if you ll have room for the complete dataset in a database of some sort if not if your result set will be too large to keep in memory a simple way to fix that would be to use an h2 database with local file storage
my approach configured the map reduce program to use 16 reducers so the final output consisted of 16 files part 00000 to part 00015 of 300 mb and the keys were sorted in the same order for both the input files
but it s hard to guarantee that it will work because the input seems to be hard
so that copy shuffle merge data flow option between map and reduce will not work even though hadoop jobtracker retry to do it
it can be pointed at hbase see https cwiki apache org hive hbaseintegration html but the integration results in hbase having tables that are forced into a mostly rectangular relational like schema that is not optimal for hbase
one good strategy is to store the raw metrics in hbase or on plain hdfs might want to look at flume if these metrics are coming from log files and run periodic mapreduce jobs even every 5 minutes to create pre aggregated results that you can store in plain rectangular files that you can query through hive
finally another option is to use something like storm which runs on hadoop to collect and analyze data in real time and store the results for querying as mentioned above or storing them in hbase for display through a custom user interface that queries hbase directly
i m going to go out on a limb here but i think it is because the file is pulled to the local distributed cache by the slaves not pushed
since they are pulled they have no way to access that local path
i usually find it worth it since just writing a small store function is a lot less java than a whole mapreduce program
unfortunately tuple doesn t have a remove or delete method so you ll have to rewrite the entire tuple
i ve managed to get this working to the point where jobs are dispatched tasks executed and results compiled
that can cause problems
your second mapper has the following signature but you define the following in your driver code the reducer is expecting intwritable intwritable as input so you should just amend your driver code to
in the reduce stage you basically get all the sums from your mappers and sum the sums up note that this is fairly small n times a single integer where n is the number of mappers in relation to your huge input files and therefore a single reducer is really not a scalability bottleneck
without any further information i would say this is the probably cause of your runtime errors unless you have two clusters my guess is you meant the app path to point to the same hdfs instance as the one named in your namenode property in which case try you might also want to change the queuename to a real queue name probably default unless jobtracker bigdata com 8021 is the actual name of your queue aside from those observations try and post the actual runtime error you re seeing
i think it isn t a good idea to query mediaapi during your batch processing due to network latency your processing will be considerably slowed down single point of failure if the api or your internet connection goes down your calculation will be aborted external dependency its hard to repeat the calculation and got the same result legal issues and a ban possibility the possible solution to your problem is to download the whole wikipedia dump
each article contains links to that article in other languages in a predefined format so you can easily write a map reduce job that collects that information and builds a correspondence between english article name and the rest
here s what i would try copy the data in that partition to some other location in hdfs
you may need to do this as the hive or hdfs user depending on how your permissions are set up
you can also try msck repair table xc bonus after any changes to partition so it reflects correctly
i tried to write my own multipleoutputs class but that failed because it needs to call a private method somewhere in the hadoop classes
you can find the solution here http wiki apache org hadoop faq how do i get each of a job 27s maps to work on one complete input file and not allow the framework to split up the files 3f the easiest way i would suggest is to set mapred min split size to a large value so that your files do not get split
rather then depending on the min split size i would suggest an easier way is to gzip your files
there is a way to compress files using gzip http www gzip org if you are on linux you compress the extracted data with now that you have this pass this data as your input in your hadoop streaming job
assuming your two puts are not sent from the same client in which case they may be part of the same transaction and unless hbase will crash or a timeout occur say because of compaction somewhere between the the puts
you re two puts will just be applied serially in the hbase depending on the order they arrived
but i don t think it is possible to hold a row lock for a very long time because the locking happens inside hbase and cannot be controlled externally
client 1 sends put client 2 sends put hbase locks row for client 1 hbase sends an error to client 2 because the row is locked hbase writes client 1 s data hbase unlocks the row following the ip address and login time example from the previous question it means that if someone logs in twice at the same time from different ip addresses then only one ip will be written to the database but the timestamp will match the ip written
according to the isempty documentation in your case it doesn t work since c is just one outer bag containing one tuple line with fields from aa and bb you may apply the bincond operator on each field from aa instead to check and replace values e g but if you stick to isempty then the following will do the job note i think there might be a typo in the pig documentation at the isempty section
later this was replaced by left join which causes the same issue you described
to verfiy run you should expect to see both hcatalog core 0 5 0 and hcatalog server extensions 0 5 0 the version might be different depending on how your distribution packages it
i m suggesting 777 permissions read write and execute for all owner group and all other users because it is the most permissive and will guarantee to get you through this bug
for evaluating a hadoop recommendation job in mahout have a look at you can also write some scripts and download the recommendation results to local filesystem for evaluation
and change agent sinks hdfs sink hdfs calltimeout 180000 because the default is 10000 ms which is very less time for hdfs to react
generally speaking mapred job shuffle input buffer percent 0 70 will not trigger outofmemory error because this configuration ensures at most 70 of reducer s heap is used to store shuffled data
however there are two scenarios that may cause outofmemory error in my practice
so the memory usage may exceed 70 of heap in shuffle phase which may cause outofmemory error
this paragraph is from pig s blog however shuffle phase is controlled by hadoop itself so that spillablememorymanager does not take effect in shuffle phase exactly speaking it can take effect in combine which is used in group by
it ll not read the file as a whole so the burden will be low imho
but latter would incur extra overhead and performance will go down because you are talking about concatenating all the files into one and feeding it to just 1 mapper
fyi if you really need to do that you have to set issplittable to false in your inputformat class otherwise the framework will split the file based on your inputformat
since the large file formed will obviously be distributed in hdfs i assume you are using hdfs and will be processed by multiple mappers and reducers concurrently
if you concatenate all the files first and then use as input this will usually be less efficient mainly because you re copying all the files to a single node to concatenate them and then pushing the data back up to hdfs as a single file
this is even before you then get to process the file again in a mapper or more depending on splittability of your input format split compression codec
is there particular reason you want all files to flow through a single mapper which is what it sounds like is you are trying to achieve by doing these two options
there was a spacing issue in the xml in between the opening and closing and tags
do let me know the result
it might be because you don t have munge plugin installed
so your etc hosts in each machine should look something like machine 1 machine 2 and this is so that the amazon instances machines can resolve each other if you are anyhow planning to map them
this line seems to cause the problem
hence the main problem is you are passing a text as a key and that is causing the issue
try and lower the value to cause a connection timeout to be thrown sooner 180000 is 3 mins try 30000 instead
it looks like emr takes care of the lzo compression for you but for the sequence file format you need to add the following hadoop input format field to your mrjob class there s another gotcha too quoting from the aws hosted google ngrams page that means each row is prepended with and extra long tab so any line parsing you do in your mapper method needs to account for the prepended info as well
try hive e select from sampletable with your second one i m guessing you are passing in a hdfs path for some reason
using 127 0 0 1 for hdfs wont help when you are executing from your windows box because this is mapped to local i p
at that point you won t be able to ssh anymore because your cluster simply won t exist
at that point if you try to run elastic mapreduce ssh jobflow jobid it will simply wait because the cluster is not available yet
depending on the nature of your job the running step could take a while or be very short it depends what amount of data you re processing and the nature of your computations
once the cluster has finished shutting down it will enter a terminal state of either completed or failed depending on whether your job succeeded or not
when you create your jobflow you have the option to enable debugging so you could do something like that what that means is that all the logs for your job will end up being written to the s3 bucket specified you have to own this bucket of course and have permission to write to it
you can also try to do a pseudo distributed deployment in which all of the processes run on a single vm and thus avoid the need to even consider multiple os s
first to answer your question about job properties it is used to parametrize the workflow the variables in the flow are replaced with the values specified in job properties so you can set the job tracker and namenode in job properties and use the variables in workflow xml or you can set it directly just in workflow xml
it seems suspicious for two reasons normally job tracker s web ui is accessible at http ip 50030 but that is not the port that you are supposed to use for this configuration
for a hadoop job configuration the job tracker port is usually 8021 9001 or 8012 so it seems your problem is with setting the correct job tracker and name node as opposed to setting it in the correct place
you define the properties file so that the workflow could be parametarized
this is a problem with the releases resolving shared libraries with maven and has been since fixed if you use git master
notice in the results that there s a duplicate hash
that s because the record 30000 sydney joseph appears twice in the source dataset
results 1 example 2 same basic logic as example 1 but this time placing a simple unordered rank on the data
notice in the results that all of the hash keys are unique
results 2
rss pig rss txt results for rss pig original answer there are several methods that would work here so i ll cover two substring and regex extract
as long as this mrd job outputs results of its work directly into hive table it should be run under hdfs user
that s why under hdfs user this job results in java lang runtimeexception java lang classnotfoundexception class com bigdata hadoop mymap not found
yet a more important problem remains how to run a job under regular user so it has permission to write data into a hive table
hence your 16 files generating 26 mappers may not be because of speculative execution
i had the same error but it was not due to the full disk problem and i think the inverse where there were files and blocks referenced by in the namenode that did not exist on any datanodes
thus hdfs dfs ls shows the files but any operation on them fails e g
my solution was isolate the location using copytolocal which resulted in copytolocal cannot obtain block length for locatedblock bp 1918381527 10 74 2 77 1420822494740 blk 1120909039 47667041 getblocksize 1231 corrupt false offset 0 locs 10 74 2 168 50010 10 74 2 166 50010 10 74 2 164 50010 for several files get a list of the local directories using ls 1 baddirs out get rid of the local files from the first copytolocal use for files incat baddirs out do echo files hdfs dfs copytolocal files this will produce a list of directories checks and errors where files are found
there are some files that opened by flume but never closed i am not sure about your reason
may be you have not specified any temp directories so it could not find any valid directory to store the intermediate data
since the original hashset values is never used again you are constructing all those text objects for no reason at all
instead of you can simply write edit i just saw the additional code you posted as an answer from your cleanup method the reason this code gives you concurrentmodificationerror is that foreach loops don t support modification of the collection you are iterating over
try this installtion steps it is worked for me change the versions in below steps depends on what version you need
based on the messsage connecting to resourcemanager at 0 0 0 0 8030 are you sure your resourcemanager is supposed to be at 0 0 0 0 8030 the default
i am using apache hadoop version 2 7 2 so it might be like apples to oranges comparison however i ran into the same silent stuck state the other day
in practice it ll be equivalent of using m 2 b buckets log2m log2m b because the first b bits will always be the same so only log2m b bits will be used to choose the hll bucket
as the api mentions therefore in my case it was reusing the same longwritable and text objects
i encountered the same error the workaround i did was to change the self invoke hadoop fs mkdir path to self invoke hadoop fs mkdir p path the file modified was usr lib python2 6 site packages mrjob hadoop py my mrjob have been running for couple of months now without any troubles so this looks fine to me
we had the a similar issue and that is what resolved the odbc driver issue in both tableau and excel
but due to the levels of nesting within your data hive is seeing a requirement for greater than three levels of delimiters
hdfs is the most flexible in that you can access it from pig mapreduce code you write hive cloudera impala and others
many projects including hive will run on spark giving you the ability to do sql like queries on big data and get results very quickly blog post now that your data is loaded you need to run those end of day reports
regardless of which tool you choose for this step i recommend looking into oozie to automate the ingestion analaytics and movement of results back out of the cluster sqoop export for this
oozie allows you to schedule recurring workflows like yours so you can focus on the results not the process
not sure if the question is exactly the same problem i checked the log files generated by the data node usr local hadoop 2 2 0 logs hadoop mrp datanode mrp local out and found the following entry based on this i concluded that something is wrong with the hdfs data on the datanode
i can t verify this screws things up because i don t have any errors in any of my log files however once i followed workaround 1 deleting recreating namenode datanode folders then reformatting on this post no data nodes are started i was able to load up the datanode and get everything working
since native library isn t supported on mac if you want to suppress this warning add this to the log4j properties in hadoop home libexec etc hadoop
it s been a while since i set up a hive2 server but you may want to define the ip address or host in the hive site xml using the hive server2 thrift bind host property
there will be differences affecting your solution depending on the answers

when you override some method in a child class that means that same method must be there in parent class with same signature and your program is failing in that only
this kind of errors typically indicates that signature of method in child is not matching with that in parent class hence technically speaking you are not overriding anything and hence scala is telling you that error home ans4175 activator scala hbase src main scala com example hello scala 85 method reduce overrides nothing
i actually found the error it is because you are never closing the created stream in writer stream fs create path
for some reason the close doesn t propagate down to the stream you just created there
thanks to thomas
my solution is based on using an el function basically a udf but for oozie
the correct spark home location must be specified in the code that runs on the local machine basically the local machine doesn t have privileges to hdfs because the classpath does not include hadoop conf dir
hence the warehouse and tmp directories are in hadoop but the table directory creation failures are stored in the local file system
the root cause of your problem is in the stack trace this means that your hadoop common jar version is not in sync with your hadoop hdfs jar version or you may have a mix of different versions in your class path
it would be better if you can show the full stack trace so that i can help you solve it easily
unfortunately you didn t include the code that threw the exception so i can t fully trace it for you
your stack trace is similar to one in another so question here pass a delete or a put error in hbase mapreduce that one solved the issue by commenting out job setnumreducetasks 0 there is a similar so question that had the same exception but couldn t solve the problem that way
i wanted to show that sometimes there is a reason to set the number of reduce tasks to zero
if you really don t want to write a new r script to do this you can wrap it in a bash script so it looks like they are one script
thomas jungblut was right it was because of the mini cluster
since bzip2 is splittable you dont need to split it manually into 1gb files as in your option2 and do processing on them hadoop anyway have to store them into blocks of specified size and process on the input splits configured
from what i read here pytz will give an unknown timezone error for a a few reasons
if you dont give it a timezone name or if the timezone name you give it depending on your operating system isn t be the same as the timezone names pytz uses
create new namenode and datanode directories and modify hdfs site xml accordingly
the cause is that the arch specific script etc profile d hadoop sh declares the hadoop slaves environment variable
because hadoop is natively written in java the python community on hadoop is far smaller
it works as a static because it only takes the function in that case not the entire myclass object
and that typo has caused such effect
i just tried that with 5 node phd30 cluster and everything was ok in build gradle i used phd30 packages instead of vanilla which depends on hadoop 2 6 0
in this case i suspect that the grant command was applied to some user localhost so that remote connections are blocked have a look at the answers to that post to get the idea
as your sqoop host is xyz the user from machine xyz is visiting the machine abc but the password is wrong or maybe there isn t a user from machine xyz is allowed to visit abc so the db from the abc throw out this error and xyz sqoop print this message
so modify this accordingly
open a ticket to your hadoop admin so that he she retarts the damn service
the cause of these issues were hive upgrades in cosmos
basically you want to run a oozie workflow for bunch mr jobs based on data availability at scheduled time of the day
hence when the classes blow up while being loaded by the classloader they are in effect removed and hence why further down the line the job reports noclassdeffounderror as opposed to a classnotfoundexception
i think that because hadoop release 2 7 1 release drops support for jdk6 runtime and works with jdk 7 only the issue you are facing might be because of older sl4j jar
from the hbase project site hbase is made for hadoop rows can stores different columns in a column family and updated values have timestamp so you can go back in the history of the cell hbase and hadoop are made for mareduce jobs rows can be input output for a job in my case i had a lot of small file 200 kb 1 mb and now i store these files in a table with some column as header information and a column for the binary content of the file and the file name as key the file name is a uuid
for example because for each dynamic partition hive allocates a memory portion
after a couple of attempts found that the error is due to a flaw in the way mysql map reduce works
answering this one so that any one else who are stuck with this one can go forward with ease
therefore you need to pass the class object
i think having the nodes in separate flannel subnets introduces some nat related rules which cause such issues
if you want to save it as an rdd with saveastextfile you have to convert it to an rdd the parallelize method in sparkcontext turns a collection of values into an rdd so you need to turn the single value to a single element sequence first
the result is often disastrous because of non default string formats
by the way double is disastrous in itself because of subtle rounding errors e g
hdinsight uses azure blob storage as its hdfs store by default therefore your output is in your storage account associated with the cluster
i used above steps on my local cluster and its working fine so you need to add these jars before running your load
check the status of the cloudera scm server service using depending on your flavour of linux or look for the status active active running but if you find active active exited you may have a problem during the startup of the cloudera scm server
the logs should show if there are any errors possibly issues with memory allocation since the free tier servers have limited memory available
reason out of memory
i can see this because in the imports you see packages such as org apache hadoop mapreduce mapper whereas before version 2 it was called org apache hadoop mapred mapper
in our investigation we found that the reason for this was in fact composite primary key violation on sql server side for which we did not have any visibility on our hadoop cluster end
add the following lines to this file after this open a new terminal window and do the result should have the path that we set in the previous step in the front prepended now start kylin should work smoothly
this last item leads to occasional relatively rare closedchannelexception which appears to be recoverable by retrying to append
you can see what it will run on line 434 exec java dproc command java heap max hadoop opts classpath classpath class so if you type hadoop version it will run removed classpath stuff to keep it short java dproc version xmx1000m classpath libs org apache hadoop util versioninfo if you type hadoop version you get java dproc version xmx1000m classpath libs version so because the default behavior is to set class to command you basically end up with it running java version which is what you re getting
it s caused by java lang nosuchfilederror
i got this issue as well today and spent quite a long time to figure out what the actual root cause is
i know there are people that don t recommend the use of ls for these kind of problems but i am using grep o to create a new line so i ll know what strings to expect and i know what the file name pattern is so this will work perfectly
some things to check since you are using an external zookeeper ensemble add the hbase zookeeper quorum property value in hbase site xml
just upgrade zookeeper3 4 5 to zookeeper3 4 6 and synchronize the time but there are many info message still so i modified log4j like that log4j properties log4j logger org apache zookeeper warn log4j logger org apache hadoop hbase client warn log4j logger org apache hadoop hbase zookeeper warn just ok
it s a common mistake since they are mainly in 2 x for most
you are getting the error because avg is a relation and you need to use a column in the relation avg correct your last pig statement to refer to the first column in the relation avg like this alternatively you can name the column and refer to it as well like this
since you are modifying the table first you disable the table then modify the table
the only difference between shell and java api is that shell automatically performs all but in java api table needs to be disabled first explicitly to achieve second drop operation and last operation creates it again so new table is enabled by default
in which case the partitioner will probably need to implement configurable so you can use a configurable object to set the array up in some way
your problem is most likely related to the fact that the iterable text is reusing the text objects so it doesnt give you a new object each time it just reuses the same object
at a minimum you need to change these two lines to otherwise you re just comparing the same object because oldvalue will always point at the object you re comparing it too
p s after struggling hours when i ran into this issue it was due to ambari server running python2 6 and agent running in python2 7 for me
when i first ran my docker i didn t specify a hostname to use for my container so it was assigned a random default value which in this case was 453af3bd9164
however this causes dns lookup issues and you need to make sure your docker container s host computer name and the docker container s name are the same
the error occurs when tableau try to run something like this since you can check the schema and tables
this aggregation may cause the problem
the issue is because you are using hadoop3 which is still in second alpha test stage simple solution is remove it and install hadoop2 7 3
the issue might be because of the incompatibility between your hive version and the hadoop version
hadoop3 is very latest and hive 0 12 is very old version so you can either try upgrading your hive to any of the latest versions like hive2 1 1 or you can try downgrading your hadoop version to hadoop2 x
i knew to use ant since it is referenced in the build xml file found in the repository
download hadoop binary link and put it in your home directory you can choose a different hadoop version if you like and change the next steps accordingly unzip the folder in your home directory using the following command
noclassdeffounderror is almost always caused by dependency collisions
your first query does not work because in the first select statement you are just getting one column d order type but you are trying to order by another column d opr time which you have not included in your select statement note that if you added the column d opr time to your first query it would work your second query works because in the subquery you have selected all the columns of d d so when you order by opr time that column is present
edited according to the hive documentation so this query shouldn t work either because the select clause has an additional column d order type that is not included in the group by clause
2 points to note efficient storage using parquet it is better to store data in parquet format rather than a csv because its saves a lot of space and with spark with parquet due to its columnar format will give you better performance for queries because of predicate pushdown
please let me know if you are using different file format so that i try to replicate the use
added the following to the following hive config parameters in cloudera manager hiveserver2 advanced configuration snippet safety valve for hive site xml hive client advanced configuration snippet safety valve for hive site xml necessary so that hue would work worked without problem error
you can try where dns is address of name node of your hadoop cluster and port is port on which hdfs is listening where default value depends on hadoop distribution
you can check it in core site xml in parameter fs default name or fs defaultfs depending on your hadoop version
i think the error you are posting is clear enough the files you are creating are under replicated which means the blocks of the files you are creating and which are distributed along the cluster have less copies than the replication factor usually 3 and while that situation continues in time no more rolls will be done because each time you roll the file a new under replicated file is created and the maximum allowed 30 has been reached
maybe this is because the cluster is running out of disk or because the cluster was set up with the minimum number of nodes i e
the error is due to your sparkmaster was not able to contact to your internal ip once check your etc hosts file weather it pointing to proper host name or your previous ip address might have changed
to number returns decimal but you can cast the result to integer select cast to number my column as integer from my db
this query give me the distance fo randonnee where name is montagne de murdjadu or result
this is not a perfect solution because all of the dependencies in the new hadoop jar will be unknown to whom uses them and you will need to handle conflicts manually
i d like to point out out another issue that i noticed your merge strategy might cause you problems since you want to apply different strategies on some of the files
via s3distcp don t use the partitionby but instead iterate over all the partition permutations and write the results dynamically to each partitioned directory write a custom file committer
reason why you are getting this error is that your view doesn t have any hdfs location to it
sqoop export looks for export dir but since your view don t contain any location to it you are getting this error
you can consider reading https cwiki apache org confluence display hive languagemanual ddl languagemanualddl create drop alterview so you might think of storing the view data in a table in order to access it from oozie
if you look at the output you ll notice hadoop seanplowman namenode seans so i suspect hadoop ident string user running the scripts seanplowman command hadoop hostname seans mac see if fixing the hostname without spaces changes anything
import org apache hadoop io text that code doesn t work because inputformatclass inputformatkeyclass or inputformatvalueclass aren t actual variables
there are two column at subquery c acct nbr stage acct nbr so outer select can t stage acct nbr distinguish which colunm you want to get so you can choose c acct nbr or stage acct nbr in your select subquery you can try this
this is strictly dependent on the type of workloads running in a cluster but the general recommendation is that admins set it to be equal to the number of physical cores on the machine
the effect can be nailed down to the following code
since docker containers are ephemeral it s possible the datanode container died and therefore the data within but the namenode still knows that the file used to exist
i don t know about node affinity rules in swarm but you should try to add volume mounts to the namenode and datanode containers plus make sure they can only be scheduled on single machines assuming you have more than one since you are using swarm rather than just compose probably the same but i have made my own docker compose with hue juptyer namenode and datanode and i did test it with pyspark
first i don t have an explanation for why turning off your network would result in faster times
it will always be faster to walk it over because the inherent overhead of operating a distributed system
when you run pseudo distributed it will use all the hadoop servers namenode datanodes for data resource manager nodemanagers for compute and what you are seeing is the latencies involved in that
once the job is running the most likely cause of waiting is allocating memory
perhaps enhancements going on in the back ground that are causing issues paas
try to do it without join and use current date or current timestamp constants not unix timestamp in the where this function is not deterministic and its value is not fixed for the scope of a query execution therefore prevents proper optimization of queries this has been deprecated since 2 0 in favour of current timestamp constant
caution what you are trying to do could result in very unstable environment if you don t know what you are doing
i am using the following works for me and use s3a bucket name note for pyspark i used aws java sdk 1 7 4 jar because i wasn t able to use
now when you query the table it will use processing engine depending on the query it will use hive server along with druid
its hbase classpatth issue in your cluster but you need to add hbase jars to your classpath like this hbase classpath will give all the jars for hbase connections and etc why its working in local mode
since all the jars required are there in ide lib if you are using maven do a mvn depdency tree to understand what jars are needed in the cluster
based on that you can adjust your spark submit script
there might be jar conflict also check that carefully with local mode environment since thats working fine
age over a hundred can occur for example if you re using fairscheduler due to the difference in queue s instantaneous vs steady fair share
another option is to figure out some way to partition the input values so that the mappers are dealing with more granular chunks so that all the mappers are doing roughly the same amount of work
i m not sure exactly what you re trying to do so these suggestions might not apply
apparently the defaults are not correct so you have to add them yourself as described in this post http amitava1 blogspot in 2010 01 hadoop 0201 null pointer exception on html it worked for me
you are just passing the classname org apache hadoop mapred lib identitymapper because hadoop uses reflection to instantiate a new instance of this mapping class
obviously this isn t ideal since a small proportion of the job is guaranteed to be bringing the data to the computation as opposed to taking computation to data but it will work
the issue was produced because i had changed the package of rest classes
interestingly this appears to be a known issue and regarded as a won t fix so it s not really a bug
the following is similar and was closed with a won t fix in the comment stream https issues apache org jira browse pig 1341 there does appear to be subtleties in the casts during loads and this may help others http ofps oreilly com titles 9781449302641 data model html type strength the previous answer is spot on i ve confirmed it does return the expected result
you have executed a number of jobs which have output their contents to a folder now you want to use the compositeinputformat to merge output from each part r x in each folder and process in a single mapper the added complexity you have is one or more of the jobs was using multipleoutputs so rather than part r x files in folder1 you have and when you come to use the compositeinputformat it s erroring because folder1 has more files than folder2 and 3 in this case i think you need to amend the mapred join expr value to use some globs
you may check your listening port by or your firewall like iptables may also cause this
if you are trying to setup in hbase in pseudo distributed mode most probable reason for this adding hadoop home to path
sometimes even after doing everything as said hbase doesn t work as expected there might be several reasons for that sometimes we lack something while doing configuration and sometimes even after doing everything with all the precautions it just doesn t work logs provided by you indicate that hmaster is not able to communicate to the namenode see the etc hosts file remove 127 0 1 1 and make it 127 0 0 1 also copy hadoop core jar from your hadoop home and common configurations jar from hadoop home lib directory into the hbase lib directory also check the properties in your core site xml and hbase site xml once
maybe due to different versions dunno
edit based on comment to check if java home is set echo java home find out where your jvm is located usually at usr lib jvm java 6 sun then to set it
edit the bashrc and bash profile vi bashrc or vi bash profile add the following export java home usr lib jvm java 6 sun note that the path should be based on where you found your jvm
there are so many potential problems with this code that could be causing it stockkey you should override the default hashcode method at the moment two stockkey s with the same contents will have different hashcode values as if you don t override the jvm default then its going to return a number which is to all extent and purposes is the address in memory of the two objects
i know in your partitioner you only use the name field which is a string and will have a valid implementation of hashcode but this is good practice in case in future you use the entire stock object s hashcode and wonder why two identical stock objects end up at different reducers keypartitioner you need to math abs the result of the arg0 name hashcode
the knock on effect is the mr framework will thrown an exception because it s expecting a number between 0 inclusive and the number of reducers exclusive
in some cases catching and swallowing exceptions may be ok data validation for input records for example but any exception that occurs when outputting should be thrown up to the mr framework to flag that something went wrong and the output of this mapper is wrong incomplete try context collect key val catch ioexception e e printstacktrace finally you need to explicitly declare your map and reduce output types which is causing the exception as you currently declare the map value output type as text when in fact the mapper is outputting a doublewritable i suggest that you remove the try catch block around context collect call and rerun your job or just check the logs for the map tasks and see if you see a stack trace
sometimes not setting up these environment variables may also cause error while starting the hadoop cluster
as a general observation the error specified in the op has as underlying cause the fact that hadoop can t find a serializer for a specific type which you re trying to serialize being directly or indirectly e g
hadoop cannot find a serilizer for one of the 2 reasons your type is not serializable i e
your type implements writable but hadoop for one reason or another cannot use the org apache hadoop io serializer writableserialization class
i also encountered a similar issue mine turned out to be that i was filtering all my records in the map process so nothing was being passed to reduce
with un named multiple outputs in the reduce task this still resulted in a success file and an empty part r 00000 file
i d start with investigating this it seems it causes the problem
i ve tried to restart services no effect
i am not familiar with couchdb or ravendb but in hbase you can not have secondary index so you must carefully design your row key to speed up your query
you can access hbase data in a mapreduce job because of hbase uses hdfs for its storage
i don t think you want to access the hfile directly from a mapreduce job because the raw file is encoded in a special format it is not easy to parse and it might change in future releases
this is not true since hadoop is not a database engine
hope this helps regards edit try adding this where it asks you for the output directory or fileoutputformat setoutputpath conf new path your location and you need to mention the output directory so it knows where to write the data to
edit 2 you need to mention an output directory because the tables you are writing to is stored in the memory and when you end the program all of the data in the memory is lost
for example if the program crashes all of the data is lost unless it is written to disk so the data saved to the output directory is a backup in case anything goes wrong
the contract for a map function is to emit tuples of the form key value so in this case your mapper would need to simplify the point to create a key that is to reduce its accuracy so that several neighboring points will share the same value and return that value along with the population at the current point
a reduce function receives a key and a list of all of the values that had that key in the mapper s output so our reducer could look as simple as this again in pseudocode for the example resultset above this would result in the following final result you could then take this smaller set of points and values and render them as areas of different colors on a map thus creating a visual heatmap
although i ve used simple integer counts here for simplicity in practice any type can be used as the value so you can use instances of a particular class or arrays or any other value you can produce given a single row of data at a time
this will create an database in hdfs for each reducer however so if you want everything in a single file you d need to run with a single reducer or run a secondary step to merge the databases together
i think the centroid file is fine that file is going to be trivial to pass around due to its very small size unless you are trying to have millions of clusters
hadoop is not the best fit for k means as you need to run several map reduces to get the result
bzip2 is splittable in hadoop it provides very good compression ratio but from cpu time and performances is not providing optimal results as compression is very cpu consuming
if you re using cloudera here s an article how to install a correct lzo http www cloudera com content cloudera en documentation core v5 2 x topics cm ig install gpl extras html it s not installed by default because of some license issues
they told me it is not transparent and has to be indexed so it changes what i answered above
you could look into https github com carlomedas 4mc it seems to be very promising based on description
you need to create your mysql table with a bigint because some of your output like 100322836692 are too big to fit in an integer from 2147483648 to 2147483648 so when sqoop tries to import it will look at the schema find that you re expecting an integer try to parse the integer and then fail because it s too big
when you are executing sqoop using shell for example bash or zsh you need to manually escape the arguments so that the shell won t alter them
in your example you ve put the jdbc url into quotes so that the semicolon won t be interpreted as end of the command
therefore you should remove the escaping introduced for the shell in the oozie workflow
you can make use of these properties to combine these multiple files into one file so that they are processed by a single map pig maxcombinedsplitsize specifies the size in bytes of data to be processed by a single map
a cascade uses the concept of direct graphs to build the cascade itself so if you have a flow source and a sink source pointing to the same location that in essence creates a loop and is disallowed in the concept of directed graphs since it does not go from source location a to sink location b but instead goes from source location a to sink location a
so as i was reading from one table and writing to a different table in the same database it seemed like i was reading from and writing to the same tap and causing a loop
2 if it is expected to point hdfs then please check core site xml and in that fs defaultfs has to point to hdfs namenode port then try it once error message saying that you are pointing to local file system
you are getting above exception because your output directory users msadri documents files linkage output is already created existing in the hdfs file system just remember while running map reduce job do mention the output directory which is already their in hdfs
as mentioned in the above example the same command can be run in following manner hadoop jar facebookcrawler jar com wagh wordcountjob wordcount home facebook facebook cocacola page txt home facebook crawler output 1 so output directory crawler output 1 will be created at runtime by hadoop eco system
if you followed the instructions at http opentsdb net setup hbase html to setup a single node cluster you d need to remove the properties hbase zookeeper dns interface and hbase regionserver dns interface and hbase master dns interface so that hbase and zookeeper don t bind to localhost
if it s so that version has a bug
i filed a bug report and got back an answer so it was invalidate metadata that i had failed to notice
the list tables tool is more an exploring option than a tool for production use so i would recommend to simply import the tables you need
last time we saw this it was because the cluster had only one map task
this is most probably due to version mismatch between hbase server and the hbase client jars shipped with hive 0 12 to confirm please do cd hive directory lib and ls hbase jar
so instead you should have this definitely will cause a problem unless you fix it
this might help with debugging in the future for the fm udf i also recommend making the variables temp per and count local to the exec method instead of instances of the class because they don t need to be
this probably won t cause an error but it is better coding practice
viacheslav rodionov s answer definitely points to the root cause
unless there is compelling reason to use different version
because in production hadoop environment you most likely will deal numerous other jobs and services running on the same shared hadoop infrastructure
hadoop becoming a provided dependency of cascading means that depending on cascading will no longer pull in hadoop because hadoop is meant to be provided by the target environment or by whoever creates the ultimate deployable archive
but since there appears to be some problem with compilation i d try to make it a compile dependency
finally the cause of my problem is that hadoop 2 is not only verifying the path itself to have public execution read access permission but it also verifies that all its ancestor directories should have execution permission
this can be caused by various hadoop configuration issues
the reason is that you run in local mode
the problem with the default partitioner the hashpartitioner is that the reducer in which a key value pair will end up is based on the key s hash
by using the tail k command in unix on the result of hadoop dfs getmerge or by using an inverted comparator and taking the first k as thomas jungblut suggests
note that you may have items that have the same count so you will need to count every value you get from the reduced values as a new k
map read the input key k value v pairs and send them to the reducer with the key as v and the value as k reduce the shuffle stage will sort the data based on the numeric values since they are the keys as data is sent across the network
mapreduce is slower on a single node setup because only one mapper and one reducer can work on it at any given time
for single node and multinode explanation for mapreduce complexity time for one iteration n number of simultaneous map function x since only one can work on each node then time required for mapping complete data n x since n is the time 1 mapper takes for complete data for reduce job half of the time is required as compared to the previous map since it works on two mapper outputs simultaneously therefore time n 2x for x reducers on x nodes hence the equation that every next step will take half the time than the previous one
in my case i have added the following lines to yarn site xml please note hadoop common home substitution i have added the following variable definition to mini cluster start up script it worth to note i have all mini cluster server side jars into lib relatively to mini cluster startup script the root cause of not working logging was client map reduce job starting inside new vm on yarn without knowledge where to locate hadoop yarn server nodemanager jar which contains container log4j properties file which is in turn responsible for container default logging configuration
you ll then be able to execute queries like a workaround is to use any existing table with a limit 1 or a tablesample clause but depending on the size of your table it will be less efficient
right approach at least i encourage it based on expirience assign at least one external interface that is visible to your cluster clients
since you have not mentioned what hive version you are using but base on the driver name and connection url i am assuming you are using hive 0 11 or above
its my assumption since we need to mention a database in the connection url which is a directory in hdfs
its my assumption since we need to mention a database in the connection url which is a directory in hdfs so it might need namenode service to check the existence of that directory
btw if mongo input uri or mongo output uri strings have typos it causes same error
replace by the conf object is already consumed by your job so you need to set it directly on the configuration of the job
you haven t shared the complete code so it s hard to tell but what you ve got there does not look consistent with typical usage of the mongodb connector for hadoop
the reason is both the tuple and each fields inside the tuple have the same delimiter
you can use any delimiter other than your input file have two tuples but you defined only one tuple in the load schema so you need to define the other one also
sample example input pigscript output update how to change the delimiter to something different option1 using sed this is very easy option by using sed command replace the pattern to pattern so that the delimiter will be changed from to in the same input file
emr uses private ip addresses private dns to setup hadoop hence you ll be redirected to a url like this which you could see is pointing to instance s private ip address and hence your browser cannot resolve the ip address you just have to replace the private ip address with the public ip address or public dns name of that instance obtaining the public ip address of an instance using the ec2 web interface you could login to the aws ec2 console and find the instance s ip address s using the console if you are logged into the instance and want to know it s public ip address then issue the following command which will give you back the public ip address of that instance
you need to fix three issues in your code to make it work
need slight modification in counts and results stmt logic
modified script if you face any issues in the script let me know
only way to avoid the problem is to add more nodemanager s so that you could get more disk space from that node s to process the job
then depending on the tool you use after you have to make a convertion again unfortunately
maybe just compile hbase client 1 0 1 1 jar manually i m still looking for better solution update for above found the root cause is hbase client 1 0 1 1 jar incompatibility with older versions
all twitter4j 3 x x uses this class so it would be better to download twitter jars of version 2 2 6 twitter4j core twitter4j stream twitter4j media support and replace 3 x x with these newly downloaded jars under flume lib directory
since spark 1 4 it s better to use dataframe coalesce 1 instead of dataframe repartition 1
so it appears your problem was down to you manually managing your dependencies
a few possible causes of errors conf is declared twice no compile error there
ienumerable type has not been enumerated so the data within is not known
since it has not been enumerated it makes no sense to serialize it it may not be possible to be enumerated after it is deserialized because no data will have been preserved
really depends on your overall project structure
since updating records using update command is not possible in hive and adding columns through alter command is not recommended as you have to insert values in it through same table
i m thinking this won t help on the ros container side because i am thinking each batch of sql 1 copy statement 1 ros container
before running your job do to confirm that input data is actually in that folder
it s perhaps unfortunate that the underlying default implementation doesn t make it easy to detect this kind of typo but the next best thing is to always use override in all methods you intend to override so that the compiler can help
i had this same problem and it turned out to be an due to 2 options that were getting applied with a value that was out of bounds for both of them
thanks to jonasstraub for helping to dig this all up
consider using something like oozie so you can actually build a modular workflow
since you are running docker on a mac docker runs under virtualbox not directly with the mac s memory
you probably wouldn t get these errors on a linux host since docker isn t virtualized there
you need to change the last line in the etc yum repos d bigtop repo file and set it like following gpgkey http www apache org dist bigtop bigtop 1 0 0 repos gpg key bigtop the problem was because the link of gpg key was changed so you need to change it also
it would be an extremely difficult process since all of the resource allocations happen based on the current load of the system but after restarting your entire cluster there might be entirely different workload therefore restoring the state does not make sense
because in a trouble you try everything possible and don t have time to read documents
first setup an aad application so that you can fill in the client id and client secret mentioned below
1 mapper output is stored in local fs because in most of the scenarios we are interested in output given by reducer phase which is also known as final output mapper k v pair is intermediate output which is of least importance once passed to reducer
if we store mapper output in hdfs it will be a waste of storage because hdfs have replication factor by default 3 and hence 3 times the space will be taken by data which is not at all required in further processing
due to this reason hadoop framework stores output of mapper into local file system instead of hdfs system
therefore the function won t usually do anything until the values have been consumed with next which for does implicitly
unfortunately it is not currently possible to output intermediate results from a bulk iteration
you can only output the final result at the end of the iteration
also as you correctly noticed flink cannot efficiently unroll a while loop or for loop so that won t work either
if your intermediate results are not that big one thing you can try is appending your intermediate results in the partial solution and then output everything in the end of the iteration
i changed your version to be a set of text objects since they can be read and written easily
it turns out to be caused by the broadcast usage in countervectormodel
following is the detailed cause in my case when model transform is called the vocabulary is broadcasted and saved as an attribute broadcastdic in model implicitly
therefore if the countervectormodel is saved after calling model transform the private var attribute broadcastdic is also saved
from 67 100 the actual reduce code gets executed so none of your reduce tasks are getting completed
assuming your results are in a rdd you could call collect that will aggregate all the data on your driver process
note that you should give your driver s process enough memory to be able to hold all results in memory do not forget to also increase the maximum result size
the parameters are driver memory 16g conf spark driver maxresultsize 15g this is has absolutely poor scaling behaviour in both communication complexity and memory both in the size of the result rdd
you can check the documentation for that http spark apache org docs latest programming guide html actions note that if you only want to persist the rdd because you are reusing it in several computations like cache but instead of holding it in memory hold it in disk there is also a persist method on rdds
answer to question 1 submitting spark job with the files tag followed by path to a local file downloads the file from the driver node to the cwd of all the worker nodes and thus be accessed just by using its name
short way lock files have already been mentioned but you can do this on hdfs too that way it doesn t depend on where you run the cron job from
you can instead make use of piping stdout stdin to make it happen unfortunately getmerge doesn t play well with dev stdout due to permissions and usage of crc files but you can achieve the same effect using the feature in hadoop fs put which supports reading from stdin
that s why it is recommended to use hbase over hdfs moreover although there is a bottleneck of namenode in hdfs but it does not effect hbase efficiency because it is not that every operation internal working is dependent on namenode of hdfs for instance region servers serve data for reads and writes
we can do it using mappartitions so we don t have to allocate a new hapicontext for each value if you re testing this out and want to view the parsed files you can use rdd collect as i ve mentioned in my previous answer but of course don t do that when using this in any kind of production environment
this file is added to the cache in the main method so that its available on every node for the mappers to open
you can see the files being added to the cache in main you aren t specifying the skip option so it won t try and add anything
thus patternsuris or something around there i dont have the line numbers will be null
thus patternsuris or something around there i dont have the line numbers will be null so you can either change wordcount case sensitive to default to false set it to false in the driver main method or provide a skip file to fix it
the problem may be this part of your code here getcachefiles is returning null for any reason
the morphlines configuration files will skip the first line so the actual column name doesn t matter columns are expected just in this order
on solr we should configure the fields with something similar then you should create a morphlines configuration file csv to solr morphline conf with the following code to import run the following command inside a cluster some considerations you can use sudo u hdfs to run the above command because you should not have permissiong to write in the hdfs output directory
in solrj there is fieldstatinfo through which sum max etc can be achieved there are facets and facetpivots to group data pagination is supported for rest api calls you can integrate solr results with jersey or some other web service as we have already implemented this way
this method returns the records for the specified rows from solr server which you can integrate with any rest api like jersey etc public solrdocumentlist getdata int start int pagesize solrquery query throws solrserverexception query setstart start start of your page query setrows pagesize number of rows per page log info clientutils toquerystring query true final queryresponse queryresponse solrcore query query method post post is important if you are querying huge result set note get will fail for huge results final solrdocumentlist solrdocumentlist queryresponse getresults if isresultempty solrdocumentlist check if list is empty log info hmm no records found for this query return solrdocumentlist also look at my answer in create indexes in solr on top of hbase https community hortonworks com articles 7892 spark dataframe to solr cloud runs on sandbox 232 html note i think same can be achieved with elastic search as well
it is new and developed by cloudera one of the biggest big data spark company so it s very possible that it will be developed in future not abandoned you can run spark thrift server and connect just like to normal database via jdbc
if they are not what you are looking for and you cant adjust due to some limitations then as described the link
thus just use following parameters to start your application
then i have to reorder of columns because it wont join then by name
note replace the hive metatore ip accordingly if you are trying to fix a similar problem
use the below code i think it help you result will be like this regards vinu
select uid cid count c count g from select cid uid count coid over partition by cid uid as c count tagid over partition by cid tagid as g from citydata e group by cid uid here uid userid cid cityid coid countryid tagid total mapreduce cpu time spent 0 msec ok uid cid coid tagid 100000 1 1 1 100001 1 2 2 100002 1 2 2 100000 2 2 2 time taken 3 865 seconds fetched 4 row s based on userid i hope this will be helpful
what happens is that because your c3uid is a large number it gets parsed as double and then is saved in standard double notation
do not open csv file in excel as excel could convert those big numeric values into exponential format and hence once you use spark job for importing data into hdfs it goes as it is in string format
hence be very sure that your data in csv should never be opened in excel before importing to hdfs using spark job
while spark doesn t require hadoop cluster yarn hdfs it depends on hadoop libraries
in spark limit moves all rows to a single partition and is likely to cause serious performance and stability issues
even when i tried the streamdecompressor in 0 5 1 it still failed due to a framing error
python snappy 0 5 1 defaults to the new snappy framing format and thus can t decompress the hadoop snappy files
once i built this and imported it i was able to decompress the file easily now the only issue is that this isn t technically a pip version yet so i guess i ll have to wait or just use the build from source
i tried below commands and i was able to see the results
are you sure you have checked the results on the right node in the cluster
unknownhostexception is and it is thrown at the bottom of your stack trace looking at your prompt shell linux 0he7 so i assume you re using local mode
it could be due to insufficient disk space
wrong sized executors long running tasks and tasks that result in cartesian operations
hadoop 3257 path should handle all characters since all the jiras are still open i would say renaming files or using something other than hdfs are the only options
maven dependencies example s3 client factory the last step is to provide hadoop with your s3 factory class this also can be done from command line so you can specify it in emr interface or emr sdk directly
set up a secondary namenode or high availability for your cluster so that the fsimage will periodically get created from now on
update seen txid to contain a value of 30 since this is the last transaction we will be processing during this run
bring down the namenode delete the placeholder file edits inprogress since this is not the final set of edits files to be processsed
i would suggest two improvements use bufferedmutator to batch your deletes it does exactly what you need keeps internal buffer of mutations and flushes it to hbase when buffer fills up so you do not have to worry about keeping your own list sizing and flushing it
improve your scan use keyonlyfilter since you do not need the values no need to retrieve them use scan setcacheblocks false since you do a full table scan caching all blocks on the region server does not make much sense tune scan setcaching n and scan setbatch n the n will depend on the size of your keys you should keep a balance between caching more and memory it will require but since you only transfer keys the n could be quite large i suppose
i don t need to start namenode and secondarynamenode since i use ceph as my backend storage system
read comments in the code result
parquet is default for pyspark and goes well so you can just store as parquet files hive table
thanks to jmoy for his great answer
the references are relative so the most common practice is to ensure the main and dependent jars are in the same directory
for that reason i would strongly recommend you leave the creation of the manifest to a tool that knows how to write them
it takes minutes to generate results even on fairly small data sets
the larger the data traversed the longer it will take to generate a result
i say unfortunately because i neither like nor use this language i m much more likely to program in c java
then there is r there is a lot more but this is the extent of my knowledge g i think besides the obvious focus on data that r brings to the table and thus a community of data geeks to help out with the science part as well it is a delightfully lightweight system and not too shabby at all in terms of libraries as well
when vacancies requires also python perl ruby it usually means that they are migrating from those script languages usually main languages till that time to java due to moving from startup code base to enterprise
i find that due to the many versions of python and its dependencies on c libs to be difficult to deploy though
personally i prefer clojure because it has great data manipulation support and can interop with java ecosystem
this might be due to class loading problems old version of jackson core or so
i don t know if this could be causing problem you have but it may be worth checking
and since jsonignoreproperties was added in 1 4 this might explain the problem
because you do not actively use annotation class from your code it is only associated with the class class loader would then drop this annotation as it can not find it from jar
test by doing a curl from one node to another on port 50060 and check you get an http response code be sure to replace node1 in the above with each of the values in the hadoop home conf slaves file edit so it turns out this is most probably a dns problem here s what you should try examine the hadoop home conf slaves file each entry in here needs to be in the etc hosts file for each node in your cluster or you must have them in your networks dns server once you ve asserted the hosts file on every node in your cluster or configured your dns server log into each node and check that you can ping the other cluster nodes by the names in the slaves file
this is because d is a generic option
so the line is writtern correctly as with jobconf this warning is raised to avoid this warning d option is needed and consequently a genericoptionsparser is needed to parse d option
this is possible because of the tool interface that takes care of the generic options through genericoptionsparser
indeed hadoop streaming jar has a file hadoopstreaming java responsible for jobs submitted the way above
if your query works for basic cases but fails on big data you can add a trap to see what inputs are causing a failure
i make it a practice to try to factor the logic out of the map and reduce methods so i can hit it with junit tests
connection pooling is typically more efficient than not pooling because it allows you to optimise the number of active postgresql worker processes to the hardware and workload providing admission control for work
an alternative is to have a writer process with one or more threads one connection per thread that takes finished work from the reduce workers and writes to the db so the reduce workers can get on to their next unit of work
most important if you can t do big batches of work or use a commit delay has less impact if your fsync rate is lower because of batching and group commit
i d choose the first option not just because it s easier but because it s not a good idea to pass bigger amount of data via the configuration object
from the performance viewpoint it is better then loading from hdfs since data will be passed from hdfs to local file system once per node and not once per task
i suspect hadoop is using some library that tries to resolve the hostname as it would a url and urls can t have underscores so it just errors out
edit i didn t notice before that you said you re running windows so the process for changing your hostname will differ
either you are changing the hostname so that what ever the user u have created in the metastore it still refering to the old metastore hostname
this is most probably because your combiner is running in both map and reduce phases a little known feature
it is assumed to be sorted as it is sorted prior to being sent into the combiner class and it assumed that the keys will come out untouched hence still sorted
the grouping comparator sees a transition between them and hence you get 6 calls to the reduce function if you use two mappers then the reducer knows it has two sorted segments one from each map and so still needs to sort them prior to reducing but because the number of segments is below a threshold the sort is done as an inline stream sort again the segments are assumed to be sorted
in case of fresh installation the above problem can be the effect of a name node issue try formatting the namenode using the command
reasons for this if you changed your hadoop hive version you may be specifying previous hadoop version which has ds default name hdfs localhost 54310 in core site xml in your hive 0 9 0 conf hive env sh file hadoop home may be point to some other location specified version of hadoop is not working your namenode may be in safe mode run bin hdfs dfsadmin safemode leave or bin hadoop dsfadmin safemode leave
i ve read several times that doing string splits like this can be quite intensive so you should avoid as much as possible if memory is really an issue
even with a specified reducer combiners are not guaranteed to be used so combiners are strictly optimizations that can be but are not necessarily called before reducers
the whole purpose of the combiner is to combine parts of mapper input so that the map outputs consume lesser network bandwidth when sent over to the reducer
hence no it is not possible
so in the example you give the map task that processed the first block will read the entire first block and then stream read the second block until it finds the end of line character so it s probably mostly local
how much of the second block is read depends on how long the line is it s entirely possible that a file split over 3 blocks will be processed by 3 map tasks with the second map task essentially processing no records but reading all the data from block 2 and some of 3 if a line starts in block 1 and ends in block 3
cause it turns out that there is one library called snappy for the compression of the hbase table is not well installed on the region server
check the region server log if it is caused by lzo compressor missing and you are using cloudera hadoop you can install lzo easily according to the following instruction http www cloudera com content cloudera en documentation cloudera impala v1 v1 0 1 installing and using impala ciiu lzo html
if you see it a lot then the only undesirable consequence is that you re burning through the uid space faster than you should be so you may run out of uids sooner there are 16777215 possible uids for each of metric names tag names tag values
in amazon emr do this by setting the following boostrap action we can see that this has worked by looking at the output job stats time in seconds jobid maps reduces maxmaptime minmaptime avgmaptime medianmaptime maxreducetime minreducetime avgreducetime medianreducetime alias feature outputs job 201309111450 0001 14 0 15 9 11 12 0 0 0 0 a cleansed nostop map only s3n mybucket out42 so we can see that 14 mappers were used
ag group a by x parallel 40 b foreach ag generate yourudf a a group requires a sort phase so the foreach after the group will run in the reducer
also you need to change your udf to take in a databag instead of a tuple or a scalar because each group is passed as a bag
the mapper code when reading values from files was giving an exit code of non zero at some point maybe because it was reading a huge list of values 784 at a time
in streaming you need to pass the file argument or a input so that the file is either uploaded with your streaming job or knows where to find it on hdfs
so in contrast with daniel darabos answer there are some reasons outside of experimentation to use sparkcontext addfile
however i would agree that it s not what you want to use for loading the data you are trying to process unless it s for experimentation in the interactive spark repl since it doesn t create an rdd
in this case it doesn t matter since you re doing an inner join on them being equal but hive isn t smart enough to figure that out
this will still cause a sort in order to get the top 5 customers
otherwise your mapping operation will never make progress so you would need something like this however there is a better solution without a loop
something like below i did not execute the code so you might need to clean it up a bit
if you read this http dataheads wordpress com 2013 11 21 hadoop 2 setup on 64 bit ubuntu 12 04 part 1 you will see that yarn site xml must have this entries be careful when you write aux services because the in the middle it s probably getting you that problem
you can do it with the below code or directly from the hbase shell with the command the exception is caused because the startkeys list is empty line 306 more info can be found here
first i put protobuf binary data directly into hdfs no result showed
because it doesn t work that way
and because i use sequencefile format so i use the create table syntax hope it can help others who are new to hadoop hive elephant too
to copy files to hdfs you need to use other option is to change the file path to to add jar files to the classpath take a look at distributedcache you may need to iterate over all jar files in that directory
bash does not do suffix based search for commands so it doesn t find gcloud cmd when searching for gcloud
this problem should be caused by having different versions of python in driver and yarn workers could be fixed by use the same version of python as default in driver and worker in yarn
thanks to http quabr com 26180364 cant run nutch2 on hadoop2 nutch 2 x hadoop 2 4 0 hbase 0 94 18 gora 0 5
to make sure the data is sound and then input from that result
i mean from the picture shown there it seems the streaming in this case generated by flume must be directly sent to spark streaming engine then the results will be put in hdfs
use an alias instead hive for some inexplicable reason doesn t allow aggregation functions in the order by
the syntax for an acl spec contains commas so we need to wrap that in quotes
this in turn led to a lot of vertex failures while running my scripts and re attempts failed at configuring the system
once you ve found the cause you can try adjust cms to avoid those pauses
in my case was due to windows domain not reachable
this is a little tricky since there is no chmod out of the box on windows but this is why we have cygwin
for example based on op s log output we can simply run chmod g w hadooptemp nm local dir usercache
the reason was that refer to d drive which is exfat
we need to be careful while writing map reduce program because hadoop using completely different file system and we need to consider this while writing our code and never mix mr1 and mr2 apis
its obivious that hadoop does not understand the zipfile input format so we need to customise the mapper as well as reducer so we can control what mapper emits and reducer consumes
note that this mapreduce will run on a single mapper because when customizing the record reader class provided by hadoop we are disabling the split method i e making it false
when reducer consumes it i have made the output outputkey as null so only unzipped content remains with the reducer and the number of reducer is set to one so all dumps in a single part file
we all know that hadoop cannot handle zip files on its own but java can handle with the help of its own zipfile class which can read zip file contents through zipinputstrem and zip entry through zipentry so we write a customized zipinputformat class which extends fileinputformat
note that the recordreader class returns the zipfilerecordreadeader the customized version of hadoop recordreader class we were talking about lets now slightly simplify the recordreader class ok for convenience i have given some comments in source code so you can easily understand the how files are read and write using buffer memory now lets write mapper class for the above to classes lets quickly write the reducer for the same lets quickly configure the job for mapper and reducer note that in job class we have configured inputformatclass as our zipfileinputformat class and outputformatclass be textoutputformat class
there is simply no good reason for a whole action transformation to fail on a single malformed input
exact strategy will depend on your requirements ignore log keep for further processing
since in general it can be not recoverable or waiting can be not an option due to incoming traffic i would optimistically retry in case of failure and if it doesn t succeed push raw data to an external backup system s3 for example
in fact the exchanges that are needed for the broadcast are particularly expensive because each sender needs to send to n receivers
it depends on a number of factors but the most obvious and important is that the build side hash table should fit in memory
i m not familiar with the technology that you use so not sure how and whether this approach is supported
even if you re unable to use scala testing base directly for some reason you can see how they make the configuration work
your customtext class needs to override tostring so that it knows how to de serialize the data contained within the object
since tostring method is avaiable in the class that you are inheriting from you have to override the tostring it should have given out the error before running the programm not a error but atleast a yellow notification stating that this should be overriden or am i confusing it with android studio
in your stand alone setup only one worker is working with parquetrecordwriter so it worked fine
with parquetrecordwriter it will fail since you are concurrently writing with multiple workers pls try below
you can do it using beeline command line tool is sql in file execute it additional you can define file with request result
but because of the bug the spark jdbc module may not use that registration to find the driver that implicitly matches the url
i would assume that the reason you re getting an error is because hadoop fs is no longer a command you can use to execute filesystem changes on hdfs
replace every prefix number with number cut the result from the 2nd char removing the first split the result to array by
you are getting this error because you are running like query on a map string string type column
one more possible reason which was in my case location of hdfs directory in folder properties shower user name twice i e
impala only supports timestamps within the years 1400 to 9999 so any timestamp values outside of those ranges will be null
this will give you required result import org apache spark sql hive hivecontext val hc new hivecontext sc import hc implicits val df hc sql show databases df show
alon try the below configurations i believe your issue was due to you not specifying your endpoint in the configuration set
2 to recover from this issue the issue here means the cluster crush due to osd full
it can t be 0 97 always cause it s a little risky
simply cut off the end of your code and print an intermediate result to see if you are still on track
given the data you have first problem would be that you have no commas so you must load the lines as a whole then split them later
i used two or more spaces in the transactions file because your last column appears to be one string containing spaces
something like you can then select max from the result instead of ordering
the combiner is often set to just be the reducer class so you reduce on the map side and then again on the reduce side
update 2 so now that we know that the rank as cumilative and as a result you can t filter the data early by using combiners the only thing is to do what you suggested get a secondary sort going
being able to query properties directly is one of the features you lose when moving away from sql so you need a way to maintain your own index to let you find records
adding additional search word isn t very hard since its just about which name value you want to index
what we need to do is add the directory reduce py is in to the python path because presumably classifier py is in there too
for whatever reason this place is not in the python path so it is failing to find classifier
the reason why your code might work locally is because of the current working directory in which you are running it from
coming to the java home it s set proper since you are getting a java exception otherwise it would have been a different error
the reason this didn t work from you is that you wrote split u001 escaping the backslash so you re splitting on the literal string u001 rather than on control a
the error was because the type of serialization had not been set in the configuration for mapdriver mapdriver
the reason being when you submit a mr job a lot of things happen before processing actually starts like checking the input path creation of splits creation of map tasks etc etc
cause i have deleted a large log file but didn t reclaim space in filesystem and it s still taking the disk space
that s why the result of the commands du h and df h does not match
oversimplifying things the hdfs files have the keys stored in sorted order so that looking up a particular key is fast
if you were to do it in hbase i d simply push the upwards of a trillion keys 10 days x 100b keys as the keys in the table and put some value in there to store it because you have to
these assumptions results in look up in a set of 1 trillion objects that totally size in 90 terabytes
ok found the reason i connected to the wrong port for the yarn resourcemanager
x jar will be in the current working directory of the shell script so you should change your script to java jar x jar arguments
look at the help for the command hadoop jar so the full command would look like when you run this would mean that jarfile home hduser wordcount wordcount jar mainclass wordcount args input output the mainclass is the class that contains the static void run main strings arg method inside of the jar that you would like to run
the property must be larger than 3072 mb and i had it configured to 1024 mb so the correct way is
since pig doesn t see a in this scope it checks to see if it can use a relation in your example a a1 and a2 are relations instead
it looks more like an issue with printing the same thing in both info and debug to me 2 so you re trying to run pipeline which depends on bbsanitycheck to run
bbsanitycheck complete never returns true because you never set has run to true in bbsanitycheck
so the pipeline task can never run and output hello world because its dependencies are never complete
3 that s probably because you have this pending task it s actually pipeline
i would personally not use has run as a way to check if a task has run but instead check for the existence of the result of this job
plus hive is not a true sql compliant replacement for a rdbms so it has to emulate some of the work by creating map reduce jobs
hdfs also has a fairly significant overhead due to the fact that the filesystem is meant to be spread over many systems
another idea is you may look into trying an olap cube to do the calculations and it can rebuild the indexes on the fly so that only changes will be taken into affect
due to the fact that you are really dealing with data analytics this may be an ideal solution
it is not the best choice if you have a single computer only because it essentially communicates via disk
the reason why it is popular in distributed systems is crash recovery
reuse earlier results instead of computing them again
it s just really inefficient to produce results this size
choose a different analysis and double check that you are doing the right computation because most likely you aren t but you are doing much to much work
having 1 machine only i don t think it will help you much because you may utilize the cores but you will have contention over i o since all threads will try to access the disk
instead of one large query that processes all dates you could run two or n queries that process a subset of dates and write the results into another table
setting hive txn manager org apache hadoop hive ql lockmgr dbtxnmanager causes connection error to metastore in my case metasdtore is sap ase and has multiple databases on it went back and set hive txn manager to default hive txn manager org apache hadoop hive ql lockmgr dummytxnmanager and recycled both metastore and hive server again and all worked
here is my reason ref http courses coreservlets com course materials pdf hadoop 04 mapred 6 jobexecutiononyarn pdf container is running beyond memory limits http hortonworks com blog how to plan and configure yarn in hdp 2 0 container s memory usage jvm heap size jvm perm gen native libraries memory used by spawned processes the last variable memory used by spawned processes the python code might be the culprit
hbase clients must be restarted due to the jvm caching ips indefinitely
java based clients will likely throw errors relating to connectivity to the server with changed ip because they have the old ip cached until they are restarted
i don t find that metric to be particularly useful especially since it isn t clear what it even means without diving into the code
delete the line with 127 0 1 1 this will cause loopback 3
these errors are due to dependency you should add few more libraries to compile without issues
when you delete a file or a directory it goes into trash but when you delete trash there is an interval that is configurable and depends on your setup mine s is 1h which has to pass by so that the actual deletion occurs
one of the reasons can be that you are using the wrong version of the commons library
just open that jar file in any zip viewer and go to that particular location where that class can be found the location will be something like org apache commons io fileutils and decompile that class using some class decompiler and check whether that method which the ie issymlink ljava io file z compiler is complaining is available in that class
issymlink java io file method was introduced since 2 0 version so your commons io jar should have version greater than 2 0
spark 2 0 0 since 2 0 0 spark supports a full range of subqueries
as far as i can tell from the catalyst parser source it doesn t support inner queries in a not in clause it is still possible to use outer join followed by filter to obtain the same effect
you ll still probably save money because you ll be spending less time troubleshooting your hadoop cluster and more time doing the work you wanted to do in the first place
zookeeper has been used to avoid split brain scenario so that name node state is not getting diverged due to failover
it completely depends on how your production environment setup is
again my answer is based on the scala behavior but hope this helps
in your driver class you have set the expected output of the mapper class to text for both the key and value therefore the hadoop framework is expecting your mapper class definition to have these output types and for your class to emit text for both the key and value when you call context write text text
source processors typically run on some interval based on timer driver or cron driven scheduling
that being said executesql supports being triggered by incoming flow files so you might be able to do something like put a listenhttp processor in front of executesql and whenever you want to trigger it you would invoke the http end point for listenhttp
the reason this is failing is because it is actually looking in your the default storage container rather than the testcontainer and thus not finding the example folder
this is bad practice as the file might contain milions of lines and it will crash due to insufficient amount of memory you should use rdds and not built in scala collections
sc textfile hdfs path to file txt tolocaliterator toarray mkstring will give the result as string
if you execute you ll see since schema is reported as not nullable values are not checked and and unix timestamp isnull is always false
the highest dense rank number will be the amount of distinct entries of c no quiet the best performing way due to performing two window functions but for me it was the only way getting it to work on hive 2 1 0
a generator can be traversed only once so you cannot pass the same generator to both min and max functions
a wrong solution converting it to a list may cause out of memory error on big enough input because a list holds all its elements in memory and a generator does not
result of reducer must be a two elements tuple
for better understanding let s create a simple generator and look on its behavior о ne of the features of such an object is that once exhausted you can t reuse it therefore sequential execution of max and min leads to an error so you can t use the same generator with both max and min built in functions because in the second use the generator will be exhausted
consumer and post it s results to out queue so the producer can receive the results
the producer would collect all results from the map step by key and feed those back out to the in queue
each consumer would now do the reduce step and post their results back to the out queue where the producer would do the final sort and present the results to a the ui
therefore the full state transition for the producer would be parse the input file and create work loads to drop onto the in queue
read results from the out queue until all map processes are done
combine the results by key
write all results with the same key to the in queue as one unit of work
read all results coming back on the out queue
write the result key to the out queue
write the result to the out queue
i use numberlist txt in this example because in my code on github that is the input file name
if you have set the classpath variable then you don t need to specify the classpath flag in the javac command as that will take the classpath value from the environment variable classpath the value of classpath needs to point to the actual jar file rather than jar for example set classpath myapp mylib jar depending on the platform you are on you can either use or as the delimiter between different paths
when i tried to run wordcount mapreduce code i was getting error as error security usergroupinformation priviledgedactionexception as hduser cause org apache hadoop mapreduce lib input invalidinputexception input path does not exist file user hduser wordcount i was trying to execute the wordcount mapreduce java code with input and output path as user hduser wordcount and user hduser wordcount output
also there is an another way you should set multithreadedmapper as your mapper class in job typed object call multithreadedmapper setmapperclass with you actual mapper class call multithreadedmapper setnumberofthreads with desirable concurrency level but be careful your mapper class should be thread safe and it s setup and cleanup methods would be called several times so it isn t a smart idea to mix multithreadedmapper with multipuloutput unless you implement you own multithreadedmapper inspired class
the person element will not be split up not matter what it s size is obviously if there is gb s of data between the start and end element you ll most probably run out of memory trying to buffer it into a text object continuing from the above your data will never be split up between the start and end element a person element will be sent in its entirity to a mapper so you should always be ok using something like a sax parser to further process it without fear that you re only seeing a portion of the person element
specifically my header line was and my command line was mahout trainlogistic input input csv output logistic model target mymistypedcolumn1 predictors mycolumn2 mycolumn3 types w w w features 2 passes 100 rate 50 categories 2 one another tip is dont use quotes or long column names so you should avoid the headache of does mahout did not like my column name
it seems to me that in case of regex extract all setting a field in the output schema to int will cause later a classcastexception when an arithmetic operation is performed on that field
probably because all fields remain and are treated as chararray inside the returned tuple despite the given schema
as a workaround you may set all fields to chararray and then perform an explicit cast conv then you can apply the filter you initially used you can find some more information about a similar issue in this ticket
as many others pointed out a 4tb database is not a reason to move to to hadoop hive
just as a thought have you considered moving to azure so that your infrastructure can grow with you
it can follow which data was already imported from which table so it will not import the data again
the location of this directory is usually configured in hive site xml with the property name as oozie service workflowappservice system libpath so oozie should find the jar easily
but in my case hive site xml did not include this property so oozie didn t know where to look for this jar hence the java lang noclassdeffounderror
depends on where sharedlib directory is configured on your cluster
really don t understand why it does not allow dots since i config everything according to this blog post where this setting seems to be fine
for some reason the valid format for service names changed between hadoop 2 1 0 and 2 2 0
it seems that hadoop 2 2 0 was shipped to work out of the box on 32bit machines only due to a folder structure change from 1 2 0 in which now the hadoop install lib directory has only one set of libraries those which work on 32 bit systems only
edit and because of all the above everything except the namenode is up and running which is why you would see the nogemanager resourcemanager secondarynamenode as far as i know it can t replace a namenode and datanode up and running
for hdinsight i usually use external tables because i can keep adding data in blob storage wasb while the cluster is off thus while i don t pay for it
here is a sample script you can then remove you hdinsight cluster and find the result in your blob storage at yourdefaultblobstorage blob core windows net yourclustercontainer wasbwork tweets2 if you want to use regular hive tables i would recommand to create the hdinsight cluster with it hive and oozie metastore in azure sql database there s an option for that when you create the cluster so that hive remembers where it stored its data
and then troubleshoot further based on what is presented in it
the log on the datanode says so it trys to connect to this port on the local machine which is datanode
therefore one has to add the following config lines to yarn site xml where namenode is an alias in etc hosts for the machine that runs the resource manager daemon
the problem is because when you install packages as a non root user they end up in a private directory
this is the cause of all the problem
solution is to be logged in as root or super user and then install the packages so that they end up in the system wide r library which in my case is usr lib64 r library after this there is no more any problem
since the error is with the javadoc plugin you can skip it by specifying dmaven javadoc skip true
the most relevant nugget from those docs is this so your aggregation may have to look something like this to force es to return empty buckets in that range
you even don t care if you need to update one job1 output with several job2 results
both hive and pig parse the statements you write in piglatin or hiveql and translate it into an execution plan consisting of a certain number of mapreduce jobs depending on the plan
i have made modifications in mapred site xml and yarn site xml which solved my issue since i haven t mentioned the host name property value for resource manager in yarn site xml it was trying to connect with the address 0 0 0 0 which was the cause for connection refused exception
by default spark 1879 spark s own launch scripts increase this to 128 mb so i think you ll have to do something similar in your intellij run configuration
configurations to do i suspect you might be facing connectivity or passwordless login issues because of that it s prompting you for password
when start dfs sh executed it shows log location of each datanode helps finding failure reason
hint just because you can run hdfs dfs ls does not mean your hdfs cluster is running
the fs defaultfs setting is missing so you re seeing the files on your local filesystem instead of the hdfs
the reason of your problem is that hbase will try to start a inner zk service but as there is already a java process quorumpeermain occupies the port 2181 hbase will fail to start
this is not hadoop specific it s a common good practice in it to have specific users for running daemons for security reasons for example in hadoop if you run map reduce daemons as root a malign user could launch a map reduce job which deletes not only hdfs data but operating system data for best control etc
however the properties file is actually very long and log dir was set in its own section at the end of the file by default to be kafka logs which would override my changes at the beginning and cause the errors because in directory tmp kafka logs the meta properties has broker id 0 corresponding to the default server properties set up
we must have log directory to be kafka logs 1 so that the meta properties is also unique for the broker
please check this spark faq and also there are severals question from so talking about the same for example this one
because you have 16ram and 100gb data set it will be good idea to keep persistence in disk
since your files are huge and not splittable hadoop will have trouble scheduling and distributing jobs effectively across the cluster
since you re only working with a few files have you tried a simpler distribution mechanism like launching processes on multiple machines using ssh or gnu parallel
you can write a custom inputsplit for your file but as bajafresh4life said it won t really be ideal because unless your hdfs chunk size is the same as your file size your files are going to be spread all around and there will be network overhead
note that this is not dependent on hadoop
there are a bunch of variants based on a detailed requirement study features supported by the different s w and finally a proof of concept a s w can be finalized
which is why you are not getting any results can you break this out into two statements the first where you create a field containing the evalulated content of the concat and a second to perform the matches operation or something like that completely untested
try this if the third field contains the first field then that results will be filtered
the easiest way to solve this problem is to add dlog4j debug to the vm parameters then log4j will trace the algorithm it is using to find its configuration unfortunately jens answer won t help you when you re running a scala program since scala doesn t use the standard java system property to store its classpath
there are some clues in the error messages you ll need to share your driver code with us where you create and configure the job but it appears you are not configuring the job jar that is to say the job client is not given a hint as to where your code is bundled into a jar and hence when you run your job the classes cannot be found when the map instances actually run
use instead of i suppose emr makes the output bucket before running and that means you ll already have your output directory if you specify output s3n mp maptester321mark and that might be the reason why you get this error
as far as very basic connection examples go try this blog for an example but note that the connection for hdinsight is slightly different now it s all using the templeton interface so this will get you going if you are looking to do full on mapreduce on hdinsight then you probably want to take a look at the c mapreduce examples with the sdk on codeplex
so to answer your question yes combining queries could result in speedup
to remedy this issue i took the output of the following classpath command and cleaned it up because it contains duplicates and non canonical entries appended it to the below yarn configuration directive which is found in etc hadoop conf yarn site xml and finally restarted the yarn cluster daemons the entries above that don t contain references to environment variables are the ones that i added
you can t use embeddedagent here because it only support avro sink
your second problem is caused by incorrect memory configuration
the memory for the native implementation is allocated outside of the jvm heap and can be substantial in the 1 16gb range depending on target workload
based on your log output you have configured a total max heap for tabletservers of 46mb
the error you see is because those two values would result in an oom
you can increase the total java heap in accumulo env sh and or you can tune how much space should be used for the native maps block cache and index cache in accumulo site xml how you should balance these three will depend on how much memory you have and what your workload looks like
i have removed all the config files from the config folder in accumulo and used the bootstrap config sh file in bin folder which created the config files based on the input i have given and after that i initialized accumulo again and i was able to open the shell and the error was gone
specifying custom java parameters there causes that actual workers to spin with the correct path
usage of djava library path can cause programs to no longer function if hadoop native libraries are used
the damn thing is broken in that damn release
thanks to myself
thanks to neethu
but however the cause of this error is same
this is the reason why when you login to your office domain and submit the job the job executes
this problem is caused by your environment variable settings in fact you probably put the spark home value as program files spark bin which has 2 issue you have to remove the bin spark home is just program files spark since the path to spark home contains a white space it causes a problem therefore you can set it as progra 1 spark
there is no use for the configuration files since ambari persists the configurations in ambari database
every time a service is restarted and it has a stale configuration the ambari agent is responsible for writing the latest configuration to disk
plain vanilla hadoop if you change any configuration you must be changed in 10 pcs ambari ui due to configuration store in db
you just change in management portal all changes effect reflected on all node by single point change
i ve not had problems using sudo from within a shell script run as an emr bootstrap action so it should work
since the files are replicated any write operation is going to have to find each replicated section across the network and update the file
there are potential time outs node with the block is unresponsive so you might end up with mismatched data again i don t know the internals of hadoop and an update with a node down might be handled just something i m brainstorming there are a lot of potential issues a few laid out above with updating files on the hdfs
none of them are insurmountable but they will require a performance hit to check and account for
since the hdfs s main purpose is to store data for use in mapreduce row level update isn t that important at this stage
i think it s because of the block size of the data and the whole idea of hadoop is that you don t move data around but instead you move the algorithm to the data
i worked it out so i am putting this up for anyone that comes across this on google
mahout created org apache mahout vectorizer defaultanalyzer that is build upon the standardanalyzer so you can use this in the a flag
you cannot use the standardanalyzer because it doesn t have a constructor without args this is the reason of the error you have
since the code above is missing import statements etc needed to compile it here is a fuller version that works from the command line to read and dump the output of a dict file dumpdict java i found it was necessary to explicitly tell java where all the jar files were compile like this run like this that is maybe overkill for people who use java but it may save time for those of us who don t use it that often
this is because the os may delete files at whim from the tmp directory leaving your hdfs in an unstable state
in this case use dependantcolumnfilter if you also want to apply a criteria on the value associated with the lan column then use the 5 argument signature the previous scan will thus return all columns for the rows in which the lan column is present and for which its associated value is equal to fre
the third argument is dropdependentcolumn and would prevent the lan column to be displayed in the results if set to true
the url http mymachine com 50030 is the web address for the jobtracker daemon that comes with mrv1 and hence you are not able to see it
there is no issue with your hadoop is not showing any output because there is no directory or files in home directory of the current user from which you are executing command please run the second command as instead of this will work fine and will give you correct output
the code above is fine to read a file in hdfs from a hive udf awufully inneficient because it reads the file each time the evaluation function is called buth it manages to read the file
this will not work because new configuration will be initialized by default with core default xml and core site xml see sources
in general imho you have to use next approaches one by one public void configure mapredcontext context on your udf nevertheless it may not be invoked due to defect with vectorization and or use of other than mr engines or local execution limit 5 will trigger the issue etc
in that example they use len use length instead this works fine in hive ql
my problem is that i used java11 to cooperate with hadoop so what i do is 1 rm library java 2 download java8 from https www oracle com technetwork java javase downloads jdk8 downloads 2133151 html 3 install java8jdk and 4 fix the java home in hadoop env sh 5 stop all sh 6 start dfs sh 7 start yarn sh
that s because filesystem get returns the default filesystem which according to your configuration is hdfs and can only work with paths starting with hdfs
are you using hadoop mapreduce for a specific reason to solve this problem
if you did use this method you would need to make sure the key value contains a document identifier as well as the word so that you have the word counts contained within each document
binary tools jar is relative and hence did not work
since your file is loaded on hdfs it fails to recognize the path to hdfs on your local machine when you specify the local execution type
if it does the job will fail so you can remove the directory as edit to see the output files check to see the output on the console use this edit 2 the newer hadoop cli uses for example also if you want to read gzip files you can use this
note that pig decides the hadoop version depending on which context var you have set hadoop home v1 hadoop prefix v2 if you use hadoop2 you need to recompile the piggybank which is by default compiled for hadoop1 go to pig contrib piggybank java ant dhadoopversion 23 then copy that jar over pig lib piggybank jar
a few more details because the other answers didn t work for me git clone the pig git mirror https github com apache pig cd into the cloned directory if you ve already built pig in the past in this directory you should run a clean ant clean build pig for hadoop 2 ant dhadoopversion 23 cd into piggybank cd contrib piggybank java again if you ve build piggybank before make sure to clean out the old build files ant clean build piggybank for hadoop 2 same command different directory ant dhadoopversion 23 if you don t build pig first piggybank will throw a bunch of symbol not found exceptions while compiling
in addition since i had previously built pig for hadoop 1 accidentally without running a clean i ran into runtime errors
the actual cause here is related to hcatalog
and problem was resolved because later i identified it was not pig who was creating problem rather it was hive hcatalog libraries
the result of this is now you can select the main id and value like this
i know it is a bit late for you but people definitely could profit from my response since i was seeking for very similar setup and being able to run the jobs remotely even from eclipse
in core site xml you should have the following configuration fs defaultfs note it down somewhere and check if firewall has an open port so external client could perform data related operations
now in the main class you should provide the following configuration for your job it might differ depending on your security and system constraints so this one you should probably dig yourself if you are unable to connect to server machine remotely the classpath configuration must be set according to this resource
this issue turned out to be due to the server s inability to deal with tlsv1 1 certificates when it was attempting to connect to the ca service on port 8440
now you cannot pass object from job to mapper because config is written as xml but there is a workaround serialize your object into json and then put it as string in your configuration and in mappers deserialize this json object for job for mapper
but there may be another way to do what you re trying to accomplish so the question is what does this static object do
since my object was really loading a library i ended up using the distributed cache and just instantiating the object in the m r methods
i saw this once too the namenode server needs to do a reverse lookup request so an nslookup 192 168 2 41 should return a name it doesn t so 0 0 0 0 is also recorded you don t need to hardcode address into etc hosts if you have dns working correctly i e
i got the same exceptions with hadoop 2 6 0 because my dns does not allow reverse lookup
so if you would specify dir location s other than tmp then hadoop hdfs daemons on reboot would be able to read back the data and hence no data loss even on cluster restart s
since you already have a keytab file in place you additionally need jaas config file java subjects abstraction and java callbackhandler for a successfull connection
basically the problem seems to be due to unavailability of the hadoop hdfs jars but while submitting spark application the dependent jars could not be found even after using maven assembly plugin or maven jar plugin maven dependency plugin in the maven jar plugin maven dependency plugin combination the main class jar and the dependent jars are being created but still providing the dependent jars with jar option led to the same error as follows using maven shade plugin as suggested in hadoop no filesystem for scheme file by krookedking seems to hit the problem at the right point since creating a single jar file comprising main class and all dependent classes eliminated the classpath issues
version 1 1 1 of apache hive does not contain a version that can be executed on windows only linux binaries however version 2 1 1 does have windows capabilities so even if you had your path correctly set cmd wouldn t be able to find an executable it could run since one doesn t exist in 1 1 1
hence the hack
do not forget to change the spark version to the latest one and spark home path accordingly
the problem is due to the download link you are using to download spark http apache osuosl org spark spark 2 2 1 spark 2 2 1 bin hadoop2 7 tgz to download spark without having any problem you should download it from their archive site https archive apache org dist spark for example the following download link from their archive works fine https archive apache org dist spark spark 3 0 0 spark 3 0 0 bin hadoop3 2 tgz here is the complete code to install and setup java spark and pyspark for python users you should also install pyspark using the following command
since its open source you can see how they access job tracker and name tracker
you need to make sure all the relevant dirs point away from tmp most notably dfs namenode name dir i can t tell what other dirs you have to change it depends on your config but the namenode dir is mandatory could be also sufficient
this makes sense because most drivers i ve seen in other languages python and c in my case will separate the read only actions from the method that can actually change the data structure
this page shows the usage of executequery for ddl the examples of execute here are python so you can note that all the ddl in the java example uses executequery
edit since you have to pass the class in setinputpathfilter you can t directly pass arguments but you should be able to do something similar by playing with the configuration
if you make your regexexcludepathfilter also extend from configured you can get back a configuration object which you will have initialized before with the desired values so you can get back these values inside your filter and process them in the accept
you also need to remove the constructor since it s not used anymore and check if that s a directory in which case you should return true so the content of the directory can be filtered too
jobtracker assign tasks to nodes closest to the data depending on the location of nodes and helps the namenode determine the closest chunk to a client during reads
nodemanager is responsible for launching containers that could either be a map or reduce task
if for straggler problem you mean that if first guy waits something which then causes more waits along a road who depends on that first guy then i guess there is always this problem in mr jobs
getting allocated resources naturally participate to this problem along with all other things which may cause components to wait something
for centos modify the usr lib systemd system confluent kafka service file and pass the kafka heap opts xmx512m xms512m values in that file
i m not sure if this is new for hadoop or not but setjarbyclass will tell hadoop to use an entire jar based on a single class that is contained in that jar file
1 sqoop i chose num mappers as 1 because time dim table had just around 20k rows and it s not advised to split parquet table into multiple files for such a small dataset
compress compression codec snappy parameters were recognized but did not seem made any effect 2 above command creates a directory named it s a wise idea to move it to a specific hive database directory e g
4 since table wasn t created in hive which collects stats automatically it s a good idea to collect stats https sqoop apache org docs 1 4 6 sqoopuserguide html literal sqoop import literal
start hbase based on my example hbase ui will show hadoop version as below overall you have make sure hbase lib has all binaries of only the hadoop you are trying to use with
in couchdb map reduce builds 1 dimensional indexes so that couch can quickly find any information by key
if the rank is determined by the number of copies sold then you can build that table using a sql select cursor and then assign a rank based on the order you retrieve records
since you can relatively easily find out the maximum number of copies purchased by looking at the output of the copies purchased job this may be a job in itself you could then create a custom partitioner that will divide the products according to the copies purchased
so you end up with a workflow like a job to calculate the number of copies sold per product a job that finds the highest number of copies sold based on the output of the previous job though you might be able to skip this step depending on how you implement sort
may be outputted over multiple files so you might need a simple script that merges them together
this is due to hadoop 7682 bug and you have to apply a jar patch in order to resolve this issue
try changing the default directory in hdfs site xml so that the directory that hadoop creates for the dfs is a subdir of the cygwin directory
this causes the error you re seeing
you can confirm or deny that this is the cause of your problem by converting all instances of cs cookie to cs cookie or vice versa and trying the same query again
if you no longer get the error it is due to this optimization problem
i ran it as root using command sudo bin start hbase sh i still don t know the root cause of this issue but the hbase instance is running after i took above steps
thus why don t you rename both jars to zips extract them use file folder compare tools to compare both extracted folders beyond compare winmerge etc the difference could be in manifest as well
have to be stated that amazon instances has very little local storage so it get really expensive and you should keep cluster running and pay for it just to preserve this storage
we use giraph in this way it only store minimum data in each vertex and then run the graph algorithm with giraph then we assemble the result with rich data using pig for page rank algo each vertex only needs to store vertex id rank thus it could scale to almost billion level
it enables all the nodes in the cluster to equally contribute to data transfer to hdfs
this error occurs because your browser sends request for ntlm authentication instead of kerberos
you need either create a separate policy in your ad for that type of users or you can manually from command line add mappings in client machine s registeries so that they would know about your hadoop realm kdc ksetup addkdc hadoop domain com hadoop nodewithkdc com ksetup addhosttorealmmap hadoop nodewithkdc com hadoop domain com
this is due to the hadoop version compatibility
the most likely explanation is that your client can t see the machine that the master is running on for some reason
it might however be possibble to modify xmlloader so that it works in the manner you want it to
probably by changing the conditions in the skiptotag method so that if it runs into another instance of the specified opening tag it skips ahead to that ignoring the malformed tag
address as root but have address as an element lower in the doc so it isn t foolproof
placeholders so you are passing more parameters than you got placeholders ready
i don t think the hbase zookeeper quorum is set correctly which may cause the connection timeout
you have one replica set so if your input is 600 mb it will take 1 2 gb on your cluster
also i don t think changing algorithm would improve the results drastically
opt 2 is better there is another option add one more column as key just use columns in inputting data so no more random keys needed
it seems that port 7182 is blocked due to the secuirity group configurations
if the list of extra data fields is really unknown using multiple optional value fields may help like this then you can select the extra data field value value based on the extra data field type for that field
i used distinct in pig version 0 12 x and it seems to work just as expected however i modified the query as below to achieve your expected result
i know this is 3 years old but hopefully this saves someone else the hassle and wasted effort i went through i spent waaay too much time trying to build from source to get the native libs that you need to point to with the changes to hadoop env sh to make start dfs sh and stop dfs sh work before seeing this question reading the scripts to see what they were calling hadoop prefix bin hdfs getconf namenodes and realizing that since i m only interested in pseudo distributed mode with one node of each type i can just say f the convenience script and use hadoop daemon sh to start and stop them myself
this is because native library is compiled built on 32 bit and you might be running it on 64 bit
means i am giving path of native libraries in bashrc so that os knows about it
you can do this by a doing the pre processing in the command line or b using declare and calling a bash script approach a in this example whatever goes between the backticks is the preprocessing that results in the hexadecimal number that you want to use as the name of the file approach b
create a bash script that does the processing you need to get x then a pig script as follows in approach b you don t really need to create a bash script since you could do the pre processing using command line tools and backticks as shown
i cannot find the max length of a binary but i know it s 2gb for string so that is my best guess for binary too
using storing the results of a mapper in a separate table
therefore later in the program partition 1 fails
i guess that line is implicitly converted to string here thanks to himplicits
then we have split the string into multiple strings split take the zeroth of these strings 0 then iterate somethingorother over the characters of that string foreach thus you get your char
in my case i am not using mapreduce but spark so i am just creating keyvalue s directly instead of put s
this was due to our network mtu nothing to do with the fs
our experimental mtu was far too large and was causing such behaviors
in most cases the reason for illegalaccesserror is version mismatch
however it does support the services that nutch depends on
this recently happened to me and it was because the hdfs utilization was close to 100
i want to duplicate this to hadoop map reduce archives not unpacking archives but it does not allow me to because of the answer there is not accepted
when you add an archive path project my project tar gz the archive will be extracted to my project tar gz so you need to reference the script as and if you look at the example in the document class distributedcache it implies the convention
this technique is error prone and can lead to unintentionally skipping data in the document
as a result it is fast and handles a much larger class of use cases
for average use a single reducer emitting the same key for all pairs and the values for which you want to find the average as value like that without a combiner since average is not associative i e the average of averages is not the global average
edit since you are running it from netbeans you should be able to pass them as jvm arguments dspark driver memory xg and dspark executor memory xg
the above code should get you the desired results
the error occurs because you haven t got the hbase libs in your classpath
this is caused by a bug in some versions of powermock as it conflicts with java 7 s modified bytecode validation
it works in eclipse because you configured your build path with jdk 7
this is probably because you had the wrong transaction manager at the time of creating the table or loading the data into the table
as your log says the traffic is originating from 127 0 0 1 which is not the ip address of your hostname
for cloudera single server setup the only way i found was to do the initial setup so that etc hosts doesn t have the 127 0 1 1 entry in it
when using the capacity scheduler in it s default setup it calculates resources only based on memory footprint and will ignore the cpu footprint
without being able to see your data my best guess is you have some rows which don t have the browser column and because you didn t set setfilterifmissing true on the singlecolumnvaluefilter it s including those rows
the problem was caused by loopback in my etc hosts files 127 0 01 hostname
hive is unable to read the full hdfs path due to space in 2016 07 26 15 00 00 you can use below commands
as i mentioned before that even i face a similar issue in my performance based environment
the might have failed because there is an empty as in select
for example i ve used this in previous applications although not with uber jars so it should look something like this
yes it looks like a workaround to me because i feel that this is not the best approach to implement it
anyway problem solved thanks to eliasah thanks again you deserve a cookie
use the spark hiveacid datasource http github com qubole spark acid spark needs to run with hms 3 1 1 so that the underlying datasource can take necessary locks etc
also since there s several posts on the interwebs regarding this problem here are some things that did not solve it for me surrounding the union all statements with one large select also didn t matter whether you aliased the table foo or as foo select from select col1 col2 col3 from a union all select col1 col2 col3 from b foo
it s as gordon commented 0 is max in the calculation max 0 b1 a2 depends on the previous location where it happened and it seems to be impossible to compute them in advance analytically
unfortunately this error is very generic and can occur for a number of reasons
by following https www baeldung com hbase which gave me the full stack trace of the exception that caused the nativeexception
there was issue with my sqoop split by properties in which i have mentioned cmp domain id in place of cmpdl domain id due to which the sqoop map reduce job was failing
received signal 15 sigterm could be due to a couple of reasons a user might kill the app or might container reached it s capacity resources
however since this class is private it can not be used directly
my solution might be a bit hacky copy the files wholetextfileinputformat scala and wholetextfilerecordreader scala from the apache spark repository into your project adjust the package namespaces accordingly and also the access modifiers if necessary create a stream with a filestream using the wholetextfileinputformat formatter here is an example in scala assuming that ssc is your streamingcontext
well op probably don t have the problem anymore since it was in 2017 but i was actually looking something like this and was about to give up when i found a solution to it spark 3 will incorporate a format that can be used to achieve this exact thing
but it won t because the over clause has order by ts
you result will look something like this floor ts 599 600 600 this enables sessions with timestamp 0 600 will fall in one bucket 601 1200 into another and so on
depending upon the hive version you use distinct part may may not work in count distinct session over
now since i ve seen that other hadoop hive artifacts also make use of google guava version 11 if i m not mistaken there s a good chance that calcite will find the wrong class definition for immutablesortedmap from guava 11
this is probably an issue that should be reported to the hive project since these kinds of class path collision errors are hard to diagnose
this is not an error just a warning and should not lead to sqoop job failure
when you try the path to read the file in hdfs is but if you try directory ex1 has to be placed in the root directory what you are trying to do with is to read from the root directory and i think your file isn t there because are different paths
searching for data if the search result can wait for a mapreduce to finish then its fine but if you need more swift results i would and actually am using another tool for all sort of searching e g
range queries are pretty easy in search tools such as solr and the result will be faster than a mapreduce
another reason to choose search tools is to get sort order as required
i do not expect loading to the hdfs to be a bottlneck since the load is distributed among datanodes so the network interface will be only bottleneck
i would design jobs to have their input and their output to sit in the hdfs and then run some kind of bulk load of results into the database
feedback is a problematic point since actually mr have only one result and it is transformed data
all other tricks like write failed records into hdfs files will lack functional reliability of the mr because it is a side effect
try executing same job again when cluster is not busy running many other jobs along with this one it will go through or have speculative execution to true in that case hadoop will execute the same task in another task tracker
when you start using cloudera 4 5 they move everything into parcels so this exact problem on my hive meta server was fixed by this command below
for the benefit of people who search in internet and reach this page like me you may hit 2 issues here dns resolution make sure you use fully qualified domain name for each host when hadoop is installed firewall firewall might block the ports 50060 50030 and few more ports based on your hadoop distribution 7182 7180 for cloudera
i had this error before and it was caused by dns issues
i have got through the exception data node has to be started from the root in a secure cluster
all crawling results will be stored in a crawl db
in nutch you configure an intervall where crawled results will be outdated and the crawler begins from the defined startsites
the results inside the crawl db will be synchronized to the solr index
the results inside the crawl db will be synchronized to the solr index so you are searching on the solr index
hdfs doesn t take care of new lines into consideration while splitting the file into blocks so a single line might be split across two blocks
but mapreduce does so a line in the input file will be processed by a single mapper
this is not an efficient way since a single mapper is processing a particular map file and is not distributed
sqoop is using special thread to send statuses so that the map task won t get killed by jobtracker
that message error is consequence of an unexpected workflow stop because one action failed the workflow is stopped and the others actions are trying to continue
for example if i have a csv with 4 fields which are integer string integer string i could use the regexp y always the same so i generate it with python like this greetings
one of strict mode feature is that partitions has to be specified so this is why queries with p date 20121001 in where cause are working
update your concern about relying on implementation details is valid however here are some points in your favor the bug fix is still open since 2008 and was rejected cause it didn t handle all encodings correctly aka this is a hard problem that needs more work to fix correctly the text class works explicitly with utf 8 encoding
following on point 2 since your target encoding has a newline byte sequence compatible with utf 8 as long as you can always get back the original raw bytes you should be fine
the basic issue is that the search for images the launch hadoop master script performs is not returning any results
the most likely cause of this due to the different amis that are available in different regions but it could be due to any changes you ve made to s3 bucket and hadoop version in hadoop ec2 env sh
from the launch hadoop master script so it appears that ami image is not being set to a valid image and thus the search for amis that match the various grep filters is failing the defaults for the hadoop 1 0 4 distribution are s3 bucket is hadoop images hadoop version is 0 19 0 and arch is x86 if you re using m1 small instances
thus one way around this issue is to work in the us east 1 region this is simplest or alternatively set ec2 url in your login script via export ec2 url https ec2 us east 1 amazonaws com but now you need make sure you put your keys in this region from the aws console
as for suitable values it depends on your system but typically you should create a directory for the dfs name dir on your name node server and then another directory for the dfs data dir or in most production cluster this is a csv values of directories on different disks
usually the cause is either the data nodes are not running or the dfs data dir is configured on the tmp directory which is cleared when machine restart can you include a jps command before put to make sure datanode is running and test if you can passwordless ssh between namenode and datanode
also a firewall between nodes can be causing this problem
it must be an s3 bucket because emr cluster would not persist normally after the job is done
something which really helps there is using something like cloudera s distribution which bundles compatible versions of hbase hadoop hive pig etc is there any specific reason why you want to use the 0 94 2 version of hbase
camel hdfs is supporting hadoop 1 1 or 1 2 depending on camel version in use
having said that based on the type of data you are processing inputformat may vary
it depends on availability
2 for max reduce tasks is expectedly ok btw finding out best values for max map reduce tasks is non trivial as it depends on the degree of jobs parallelism on a cluster whether mappers reducers of a job s are io or computationally intensive etc
reducer sum results of all mappers x t x σ i x i t x i x t y σ i x i t y i then parameter vector b x t x 1 x t y however better solution for parameter identification will be to use cholesky decomposition as it is done in code
resulting in am thinking container was not allocated by rm probably due to no more resource available
but since the rm had actually allocated the container it process it s job and returns the response
resulting in unknown container because from it s perspective that container was never allocated and is unknown
per donaldminer i dug deeper and found out that the completebulkload process was running as hbase which resulted in a permission denied error when trying to move rename delete the source files
then you need to do the following if you want to initialize your variable in the mapper itself you should do it in the override setup method not in the main because the main method will not be called at all like the following
well it s a bit difficult to understand what s going on because the code is badly formatted and a huge amount of code for what can be done in just a few lines
but anyway i think we can narrow down the problem to this line of code which would be much more readable if written anyway your getting a npe therefore your rdd class rdd contains a null tuple
and the above question was for spark 0 9 1 which is now out of date so it s not so useful to answer it
personally since i can t upgrade easily and the subpartitioning is too much work i just focused on optimising the jobs in other ways and be contempt with running a sequence of jobs for now
note however that there will be data loss when using hcatloader since these represent times in different ways since pig datetime represents dates to millisecond precision and hive represents to nanosecond
hive pig will result in nanoseconds being lost from the timestamp converted to the nearest millisecond
it will be supported under hive 0 13 they have an issue about this problem that was already solved you can see the issue in https issues apache org jira browse hive 5814 org apache hcatalog pig hcatloader has been deprecated in hive 0 12
as result you cannot deserialize but can write and serialize more than 700 mb into byteswritable
in case you would like to use byteswritable an option is set the capacity high enough before so you utilize 2gb not only 700mb this bug has fixed in hadoop recently so in newer versions it should work even without that
there are two possible reasons for this problem 1 there s is not enough data in the buffer flume doesn t think it has to flush yet
2 the more probable reason is that your exec source is not running properly
this can be due to a path problem with the tail command
add the full path to tail in your command like bin tail f var log apache2 access log or usr bin tail f var log apache2 access log depending on your system check for the correct path
based on the discussion in this thread the problem is caused by oom in the container
for partitioning on date field the best approach is to partition based on year month day
that said based on your requirement you should choose your partition strategy
its primarily attributed to dfs namenode handler count was not enough
increasing that may help in some small clusters but it is because of dos issue where namenode couldn t handle no
usr hdp current hadoop yarn resourcemanager sbin yarn daemon sh sources the yarn env sh script that is located in the configuration directory you specified in your case config etc hadoop conf chances are that those environment variables are being overridden in that script
one reason for that could be you have a giantic line in your data that doesn t fit into memory
i guess you are appending some data into a globalstringbuilder variable either to get a summary of the results or to get some logs
you will need to specify root dir hbase unsecure in the connection string because by default phoenix is trying to connect to hbase
those are the steps to generate the issue in a computer called origin let s create a sbt project with scala sources and compile it with internet connection halt internet connectivity verify that projects keeps on compiling duplicate sbt project or copy to a different computer destination without internet connection try to compile
it won t work because sbt will try to download dependences online and destination is an offline computer
if sbt or scala version differ then when running sbt in destination sbt will try to download the proper versions resulting in errors due to the lack of connection
if sbt and scala versions are the same then we have to copy from origin to destination the following folders origin home usera ivy2 origin home usera sbt boot make sure that your environment variables that point to sbt and scala are properly configured use a build sbt file like this one build sbt i m not sure if provided is compulsory because the joda dependency is being read properly be aware that all the dependences that you can use in destination must have been downloaded previously in origin and copied to destination
i tried to compile a simple project that only uses spark context not the spark sql so it should be able to compile with the unique dependency librarydependencies org apache spark spark core 1 3 0 provided however we tested that it does not compile
and the exception is filenotfound because the service responsible to start namenode is unable to access the filesystem since it does not have required permissions
it is because map reduce run in multiple parallel copies across the cluster so there is no concept of a single console with output
the workaround could be to export it to hdfs note do not forget to use the fully qualified path starting with hdfs since it will not work otherwise see here then simply get it
in default configuration of job first columns are the keys of result from reducer second is the value
to produce result reducer is processing all records with same keys
but if you have small amount of data as result you setup only one reducer per your job d mapred reduce tasks 1
i got the resolution reason behind is the relation name and the path folder specified have the same name in such cases it will only not iterate the sub folders or directories and produce such error
looks like this is caused in your application manager since you mention that the error is being returned after the execution of all mappers reducers
here is my final result a fully working project with your sample test
you invoke orcserde serialize method with null second argument i bet this is the reason
so in your pom xml you can try to exclude the old version that spark uses or uses methods that described in that blog post https www elastic co blog to shade or not to shade
i was using elastic search 2 4 0 client as my dependency so i found alternative shaded jar for 2 4 0
i had the same exact problem and i was able to solve this by adding guava 16 0 1 jar to addjars property and by setting sparkconf set spark driver extraclasspath guava 16 0 1 jar since spark driver extraclasspath entries will prepend to the classpath of the driver your uploaded guava jar will override the hadoop s guava jar
since you have spark on yarn i hope this would help to gather all the logs
for such aggregations depending upon configuration i believe you may need to set the number of reducers prior to execution
confirming that in my case it was caused by permission issue as pointed already by wise w what was weird is that it looked like plain select worked fine but anything more elaborate did not
perhaps some reasons might be you have a reusable process that can scale up if needed in which case it might start using more slots and not run in uber mode
one particular scenario which i experienced with apache crunch is a pipeline consists of number of mapreduce mr jobs spun by various dofn s where the core logic is written each dofn results into a map and or reduce job whose output is generally stored into a immutable distributed object ptable pcollection in this scenario based on amount of data processed by these dofn s running on ptable pcollection framework decides whether to run each mr jobs in the pipeline in uber or normal mode
consider another scenario where the m r job runs in incremental and full load mode where same logic may be fed with lesser data that can be processed by least number of mappers and a reducer and alternatively it may be fed with full load of historical data that requires larger number of mappers and reducers to process so essentially the logic remains same but data and number of inputsplits changes and in those cases you don t want to move in and out of hadoop cluster to process your data based on the size and let the framework decide the mode uber or normal
both methods are implemented as mapreduce job so execution time depends on your compute cluster as well as size of your archive files
but note with har you also have a higher look up time due to a two step indexing strategy
your class is called wordcount so it should look something like hadoop jar wordcount jar package wordcount input dir output dir your code doesn t include the package name so i ve substituted package
the error states as a result is a network issue
based on how your code is structured use or add a unique identifier for each line that remains intact during the various operations
therefore it will require at least 1 virtual cpu more
you can just check the succeeded flag of the result object returned from local
each file will need to anyways be processed one at a time since the header information is relevant and likely different for each file
you should check for all the required hive related jars and update them accordingly
if you write timestamps with impala and read them back with hive hive notices that the data was written by impala thus it requires no adjustment so timestamps written by impala show up correctly in hive
i then tried to upload to s3 using the old credentials and the credentials which were stored in the instance s metadata it failed because it was trying to use out of date credentials
the issue was due to block reports not getting generated by datanodes
this can be accomplished using a series of self joins to find other rooms in the same category before combining the results into 2 maps
code result set explanation first results are drawn from the initial table
this is a left outer join because we want to preserve all rows from the prior joins
the outcome will either be 1 the values from customer rooms and customer category rooms are identical because the customer already holds this room or 2 the values from customer category rooms will be all null because the customer doesn t hold this room but it s a room in one of the same categories
this distinction will become important so that we can preserve the date of the customer if they already hold the room
if that is significant then you might need to put more work into this to choose the right date based on some business rule e g
make sure you backup dbeaver ini with re installations or replacing with newer version dbeaver ini may get replaced in that case you can copy the lines below from your backup dbeaver ini file last step you may need or may not i init my keytab before connecting
like this but better check you current container and java heap size and increase it accordingly
i think this is due to a hive issue
trying to figure out the issue 1 start dfs sh vs start all sh check that you are using start all sh command when you are trying to start hadoop because start dfs sh will only start the namenode and datanodes 2 check the hadoop logs check for the hadoop log dir global variable value to get the log dir because it will include all exception thrown when trying to start the namenode manager and the resource manager 3 check for the installed java version the error may be thrown by an incompatible java version check that you have installed the latest java version
fix java 9 incompatibilies in hadoop hadoop error starting resourcemanager and nodemanager 4 check hadoop common issues based on the error you provided in the answer update you may find these issue links relevant jdk9 fail to run yarn application after building hadoop pkg with jdk9 in jdk9 env jdk9 resource manager failed to start after using hadoop pkg built with jdk9 more information for more information you can check my article on medium it may give you some insights installing hadoop 3 1 0 multi node cluster on ubuntu 16 04 step by step
my problem is that i used java11 to cooperate with hadoop so what i do is 1 rm library java 2 download java8 from https www oracle com technetwork java javase downloads jdk8 downloads 2133151 html 3 install java8jdk and 4 fix the java home in hadoop env sh 5 stop all sh 6 start dfs sh 7 start yarn sh
i figure out the reason for the unexpected io activity
this cache is maintained by the os file system as a performance optimization since it allows write requests to return after writing to memory and not wait for slow i os to complete
however what i ended up doing was running show partitions with hive e and using grep to filter the results afterwards
based on the query provided there are few things that you can try change your join conditions to explicit remove where clause and use inner left join
check if you have skewed data for one of the following fields store returns sr returned date sk store returns sr store sk store returns sr customer sk customer c customer sk store s store sk it might be possible the one of the key has high percent of values and that might cause 1 of the node to be overloaded when data size is huge
basically you are trying eliminate possible reasons of node overloading
since hbase is a strongly consistent system and it provides atomicity guarantees for a single row across column families all the mutations for a particular row have to go through the same server
this essentially means four things since one row can be written by only one regionserver there can never be more than one servers trying to write to and acquire lock for the same row
since the lock is in memory if the server crashes immediately after the lock acquistion the lock is automatically released
the region s responsibility will then gracefully move to a new server but your operation would have failed not accounting for automatic retries on the client
since the write lock is for the whole row a mutation to column x will cause operations to column y of the same row to get blocked
since the lock is on the value of the row key the regionserver maintains a list of currently locked rows in memory the row does not necessarily have to exist beforehand
this is also the reason the row key for which the put has been generated has to be the same as the row key for which the get operation is generated
from the stack trace the error is thrown when it s trying to read one of the configuration options so the issue is with one of the default configuration options that now require numeric format
hadoop and spark are a huge pain in this area because there are so many different places and ways to load things and java is particular about the order as well because if it doesn t happen in the right order it will just go with whatever was loaded last
i was of the impression that returns an iterator so that you could do the following correct me if i am wrong here
for some reason it can t see either where the zookeeper quorum is or where the hbase master is
the big problem that i see is you are running hbase on 2 nodes with a replication factor of 3 actually in effect just 2 as there are only 2 nodes to replicate to
after the completion of the first mapreduce job there will be a lot of output files based on the of reducers with content like this visits ip address all these files have to merged using the getmerge option
then the local file has to be sorted using the sort command based on the 1st column which is the of visits
if you have other configuration issues they will not go live which will cause the master to report having difficulties finding tservers
there were junk bytes appended to my rowkeys due to this code the problem is that text getbytes returns the actual byte array from the backend see text and the text object is reused by the mapreduce framework
for this error java sql sqlexception query returned non zero code 9 cause failed execution error return code 2 from org apache hadoop hive ql exec mapredtask at org apache hadoop hive jdbc hivestatement executequer go to this link http docs amazonwebservices com elasticmapreduce latest developerguide usingemr hive html and add to the class path of your project add this jars from the lib of hadoop and hive and try the code
note suppose you have connected using code exit from bin hive of if you are connected through bin hive then code will not connect because i think not sure only one client can connect to the hive server
because hadoop use utf 8 format you should convert the data form oracle database if they are different
there are a few reasons for this strict checking of types if you re outputting to a sequence files the header of this file contains the types of the key and value class
when i started typing this i had another reason in mind but it has escaped me for the time being
if not defined you ll be defaulted to the identity mapper reducer your specific error message is because the identity mapper just outputs the same key value types it was passed in in this case probably a key of type longwritable and value of type text as you haven t defined an input format the default is probably textinputformat
in your configuration you have defined the output key type as text but the mapper is outputting longwritable hence the error message
however i am putting new development into a different project and company called myrrix which is developing a sort of next gen recommender based on the same apis but which ought to scale without these complications as it s based on matrix factorization
so hadoop was going by the defaults i set in core site xml hence only 3 drives being used
although successfully running hadoop 0 20 0 on windows xp cygwin and windows7 cygwin i once tried setting up a newer version of hadoop on windows7 but failed miserably due to errors in hadoop
iirc hadoop with the security patch won t even run on windows7 because of problems with file permissons etc
cloudera manager creates a repo before installing and if there are any conflicts it causes that error
does this cause the problem
hadoop looks for libsnappy so in hadoop home lib native so you can try to do this create a folder structure like home user hadoop lib native put a libsnappy so and libhadoop so in this folder
please format your question properly so that it is visible properly
you can generate new tables from queries or output query results to files
consider a table based on stock information now consider the following query you would expect the following results but you would actually get this in hiveql to get the correct results you have to do the group by in an inner query and the analytic function in the outer query so in summary its always good to think about order of operations when using analytic functions and get the data you are working with to its simplest form before you use the analytic function
sorry misread your question so editing you should be able to use the libjars option in your case
this is happening because you are linking to the wrong jar please see the link below it describes this issue very well
it does this because it uses a write ahead log to achieve exactly once deliver to hdfs
actually i put 3 slashes because otherwise the tool throws an invalid schema exception
i also attached the port to the hostname so the final format is the following output dir hdfs correct hostname 8020 path to file from hdfs this error is very confusing because everywhere you look for the namenode hostname you will see the same thing that the hostname command returns
and once you split based on t how are you expecting it to be present still in the individual words
compression is only configured on the producer no configuration is required on the consumer side since each message or batch of messages are flagged with their compression type none snappy gzip
you can specify the delimiter of the fields in your daily logs like shown below where i use commas create external table mytable partitioned by day string row format delimited keys terminated by location user hive warehouse mytable when you dump your data in hdfs make sure you dump it on the same directory with day so it can be recognized as a hive partition
based on these inputs you can adjust your classpath entries in this case opencv jar or something and see whether working
thanks to zdenek s answer i fixed it by disabling all other networks and enabling only the host only network in the vm s settings
hence it is not executed you can use this instead note that this doesn t remove duplicates
your query does not work because it is unlikely that any of the keywords columns contain the string select keywords from h trends
execute as for the explanation when using webhdfs to open a file you have to do the following you don t know which node the file resides on so you ask the namenode
is this a hive managed table in that case could you print what you get when you do the error suggests that you are accessing a table from a user who is not the owner and seems like user does not have read and execute access
hadoop now uses test jar types with their dependencies so i had to do a bit of digging myself
is caused when hbase is compiled against hadoop 1 and has hadoop 2 jars on its classpath
so the issue is you have created an external table with partition
here is the useful command depending on the hadoop version that you get the path names in the build xml files that come with the hipi package for creating the jar files will be incorrect
the reason for the error is because the cloudera odbc 2 5 driver is not currently supported for impala
to see results you will have to wait for mapreduce to finish minimum dozens of seconds or minutes in case of amazon s elastic mapreduce the time depends on the amount of data and the size of your cluster
another solution that may give you results faster use a database select count distinct session id group by stage from mylogs if you have too much data to quickly execute that query it does a full table scan hdd transfer rate is about 50 150mb sec the math is simple then you can use a distributed analytic database that runs over hdfs distributed file system of hadoop
in this case your options are i list here open source projects only apache hive based on mapreduce of hadoop but if you convert your data to hive s orc format you will get results much faster
cloudera s impala not based on mapreduce can return your results in seconds
for fastest results convert your data to parquet format
anyway thnks i finally got the solution the configuration of cygwin is dos command promt based so it doesnt accept space in user name
namenode is not formating because ssh is not working
you are only spilling whenever the spillcount is a multiple of 1000 and your if condition is not met which may not happen that often depending on the logic
your implementation fits with an accumulator style implementation because you only need access to the current tuple
of course you need pay a little performance cost due to http
this is because there are strings
depends on your purpose loop and match ssdeep in different chunk size will create a n x n 1 hash comparison
finally solved this issue because java is core of hadoop so jdk should be compatible and has all necessary files which are required by hadoop run time
there used to be a writables copywritable result result result value call in an old version of the next immutablebyteswritable key result value method of tablerecordreaderimpl java
to do a copy now you need to use value copyfrom result
this will do a deep copy of the data from source to destination i am guessing you have some library mismatch which is making these calls happen and trying to cast from result result to writable writable
you can do it by running your input through a sequence file writer on the client and then using the output for uploading either the whole file or a slice representing the delta since last append
this was due to bad configuration
this jar file is present under hadoop home and the exact name of the jar file may vary depending on the hadoop distribution and verison
by some script or by following specific instructions from somewhere renaming a column family may break something else that depends on the name being retweeted status
in that case the source code of twitter hbase impala should be fixed to use the correct name
one piece of information you re not showing here is how you ve executed the command so i m guessing that you ran this path looks like it s referencing hdfs but the file should be on your local filesystem so you should try pig f local path register pig note you can also register udfs on the command line when executing your script too
try running set hive aux jars path in the two environments and compare the results
mostly the odbc driver logs on to as user hadoop which has no write access thus causing a failure in starting a map reduce job
since you are looking for a specific column hive must first check the hive schema definition which is stored in the hive metastore
your issue is due to the fact that you cannot connect to the hive metastore as indicated by the following message in your log file org apache thrift transport ttransportexception java net sockettimeoutexception read timed out try restarting your hive metastore service
the error might be because of the quotes since you have used single quotes in the beginning
since you are running a mapreduce on local you should wait the result before the junit kill your local jobtracker
i had this same problem and i think it s caused by incompatible versions of hadoop hive and spark shark
it is only 250mb depending on your cluster it shouldn t take very long at all
we also experienced issues with issuing hadoop shell commands in oozie due to security issues
it looks like it has to do with the nature of dns our our corporate vpc we wound up having to create an additional vpc and then clone the db resources into that not sure why my access to the vpc admin is restricted so i m trusting what the admin said
because you are already mentioning it in the from clause of query parameter
the technical reasons for this are well explained in this cloudera blog post you can refer this link to get methods to solve this issue
often this is because of whitespace which is hard to see try using trim product id xxxx
i ran into this with some data i inherited and since i was going to do a lot of operations on the data and because the table was only in the range of 10k records i did something to it like this the second of the two regular expressions is the most precise
turns out it s caused because sqoop sh uses posix style directory paths
this results in the script being unable to set the correct classpath
default reducer for a mapreduce job is 1 so need not set it as 1 job setnumreducetasks 0 reducer tasks wont run and output file depends on no of map part m 00000
you could consequently iterate through your list and write out your output
the cause is that your java dependancies are not complete you have lost the jar package hadoop auth 2 2 0 jar or its newer version
the reason for this warning is that the native library is compiled for 32bit by default
it seems like a problem caused by cascading
reading some of the files individually not mapreduce caused the problem consistently
this causes pig to break up the line somewhere in the middle and start looking for a datatype indication
since it s just in the middle of the line there is no valid data type indication hence the error
that way there can never be a conflict with the pig intermediate storage since it uses ctrl a ctrl b ctrl c tuple indicator none of which are alphanumerical characters
if you really want to use file scheme then use file so that values look like hth
same with stop all sh it already says so secondly hadoop namenode format formats your hdfs and should therefore be used only once at the time of installation
the above problem was raised because of the incompatible datatypes to avoid this declare you chararray as bytearray you will get rid of this error
i found a solution to this thanks to http www stewh com 2013 12 working with chinese or other utf8 encoded text in hadoop streaming i needed to add cmdenv lc ctype en gb utf 8 to the end of my hadoop streaming command
this can be caused by placing the hdfs directory in your home directory on a linux box since upon starting up and shutting down the os affects these folders not exactly sure how but to prevent this problem in the future move the hdfs directory out of your home directory
hence if you try to stablish a connection to your server from internet and your server is listening at 127 0 0 1 at your gce machine then from the server point of view a request has never been received and as a consequence goocle cloud firewall will refuse the connection because there is no server listening at the opened port in your case 50070
you have to use the meta connect flag while creating a job to create a custom sqoop metastore database so that oozie can have access
since you are using the native hsql db
therefore the program does not see hadoop
however your terminal program can see hadoop since the your terminal is configured to see hadoop
note this was an initial set up stage hence no data was present in the hdfs
in hive should create a new table with the results of the query
in default mode shark server was unable to write a file because of permission denied error
ok so it looks like i ve answered my own question
you can simply do which results in a list of tuples
from the docs your master is the top level actor in your application therefore he is a child of the user guardian so he ll be restarted automatically because supervision for the guardian is defaulting to
if there is anything that can cause an actor to get an exception it should be done by a child actor
because you passed the libjar argument as the vertex class file
hdfs is the owner of the hadoop file system so you are able to create directories using hdfs user refer bellow mention commands to create directory or to copy files or make sure the user from whom your are running the command have needed permissions on the directory you are running the command
you need to assign that to a variable so that you can do something with it later
you either forgot to add util jar to classpath or for some reason it was not included could be that is was intentionally excluded with maven by tag
the result of execution is file already exist in txt
write a head log option is false in your hbase client program like mapreduce for performance reasons
batch index works fine since it doesn t work on wal
update the issue hadoop 7139 now it s closed and from version 2 6 1 2 7 2 it s possible to append to an existing sequencefile i was using version 2 7 1 and looking for append to a sequencefile so i downgraded to 2 6 1 because version 2 7 2 it s not still out
but the point is hbase yarn are not dependent on each other
and in that case both can coexist
this issue can be for many reasons you need to check r u reaching the limit of number of jobs
1 unable to create logs due to insufficient space in the logs directory
i suspect that you do not have an agent name environment variable so it s being replaced with empty string
a non external table belongs soley to hive and when deleted will result in metastore and hdfs data being removed
a non external table belongs soley to hive and when deleted will result in metastore and hdfs data being removed so you can either try deleting the hdfs data explicitly or define the table as being internal to hive
the solution is not specific to the exceptions mentioned here but eventually i was able to overcome all issue in spark using the following guidelines all machines should be tweaked in terms of ulimit and process memory as follows adding the following to etc security limits conf to etc pam d common session and to etc pam d common session noninteractive core usage if using a vm i would recommend allocating n 1 cores for spark and leaving 1 core for communication and other tasks
for me currently version 1 2 fixed a bug which would cause my job to fail
but since you re in java why on earth would you want to do a haddop fs put in an external process when the java api is even more friendly than the shell
they are less important because spark s in memory computation
see what happens to them after evolution map reduce you just wrote two new methods specifying older signature so they just don t override anything nowhere being called
the code is doing nothing since the actual methods being called have empty bodies i don t think there is a default implementation and if there is that will be identity operations only
view your result by this will successfully run your wordcount program
check your code for any bug which causes same file to be accessed simultaneously this can also happen when a mapper access a file which is already deleted
there isn t any guarantee about the order in which the tasks will be processed because the speed advantage partially is based on the fact that the worker nodes don t have to synchronize state
your problem doesn t fit because it needs to know the last read value alternately retrieved from a or b
you cannot parallize the read steps because you can t know in advance if you have to read a or b
you might want to add the following option to tell the partitioner that you want to sort by the compound key so that your reducer input is sorted
so as result i ll get the following proxying chain which is fully transparent to clients client your boss connects to server via port 80 nginx or apache is listening port 80 nginx sends http requests to cloudera on port 7180 nginx returns request result to client your boss
because the java version i used is 1 7 but the hive only support 1 6
from the comments no java processes are running and thus neither the namenode nor jobtracker are running
depending on the version of hadoop you may be able to do or after that you will need to examine the hdfs logs to see what are the issues
seems like this is because of protocol mismatch between two clusters
in mr2 no longer we use jobtracker so configuring of mapred site xml with jobtracker is not using by hadoop
the coordinator xml working is some points i have observed are the directory structure expected is based on initial instance 2015 01 12t04 02z and frequency 30 of dataset we define
while scheduling any workflow keep gmt in mind and schedule accordingly
you could also try to use the columnslicefilter which would limit the results to the column qualifier that you want and easily write a summingiterator or just sum them client side
so the directory order in the classpath looked like this opt cloudera parcels cdh 5 1 2 1 cdh5 1 2 p0 3 lib flume ng lib var lib flume ng plugins d twitter streaming lib unfortunately there was a twitter4j stream 3 0 3 jar and twitter4j core 3 0 3 jar in the parcel directory and flume tried to use that instead of 3 0 6 and in that version filterquery language obviously doesn t exist
this is been asked many times and answered as well searching with the exception message would give you the results
coming to the problem statement it was most probably due to the hadoop tmp dir where your namenode stores the edit logs and and check point data
after every reboot of your machine tmp folder will be cleared by many services which causing the problem while trying to access by namenode again
1 i am concatenating a because my logic requires it
if you need to perform any aggregation in that case you have to write an udf where you can pass the bag and parse through the members to find the sum or you have to restructure the data in such a way that it contains a bag of counter here
the build error is due to maven generics which is a popular google search issue
yes i finally found a way to load file data into hive table load data inpath wasb tempdata emp dat overwrite into table employee this works only for default container because the authority part of the uri s do not match if the containers are different even though they belong to same storage account
drill directly recognizes the schema of the file based on the metadata
hence setting it from your mapreduce job doesnt have any impact at all
in my case the cause of the problem was misconfiguration of yarn and map reduce
i know that it s ugly but it works so it s better that nothing
this happened due to different version of protobuf jar used
the cqlrecordwriter used by the cqloutputformat doesn t support insert statements only update statements so you will need to use update to insert your data
typically in this situation you leave the splits alone so that you can get data locality for the blocks and have your recordreader understand how to start the reading from the first record in the block split and to read into the next block where the final record does not end at the exact end of the split
mapreduce apis and it is causing a conflict
if you want to scan based on column values then below are best ways solr cdh search https wiki apache org solr hindex coprocessor based approach https communities intel com community itpeernetwork datastack blog 2013 10 30 coprocessor based secondary index on hbase
edit also try setting batch and buffer sizes depending on your network bandwidth
precisely the reason why in the reducer you never get a list of the values for a particular key
the error is caused as the hadoop streaming environment variable is not set in your code
i had no luck with these answers pig version 0 15 0 was still writing pigbag files to tmp dir so i just renamed my tmp dir and created a symbolic link to the desired location like this make sure there are no active applications writing to tmp folder at the time of running these commands
jobtracker can refer to either the jobtracker or the resourcemanager based on the hadoop version in use and copy all hadoop settings into oozie conf hadoop conf folder
based on the error you get the issue is not with the script
these 3 columns will be enough to derive the expected results
these 3 columns will be enough to derive the expected results so you may only use the subjects txt and skip the join process
the result of this phase will be campus1 maths 3500 campus2 chemistry 4190 campus1 law 3200
this results contain the visit count for every subject on every campus but unordered
at the reducer method use an incrementer variable upto 20 and emit the results exit from the loop once after exeeding 20 within this 20 iteration prepare a string or any array to represent the details about the campus subject visits to be emitted as result
we re going to make this much easier with future releases mostly because it just seem to be what users want to do
in a few words each file block is assigned to a map task in order all the mappers perform the same operation on the chuncks once finished the output partial results are sent to the reducers in order to aggregate the data in some way
in this case the ssh and libsnappy errors are red herrings when the vms weren t immediately ssh able bdutil polled for awhile until it should ve printed out something like likewise the libsnappy error you saw was a red herring because it s coming from a call to dpkg s trying to determine whether a package is indeed installed and if not to apt get install it https github com googlecloudplatform bdutil blob master libexec bdutil helpers sh l163 we ll work on cleaning up these error messages since they can be misleading
in the meantime the main issue here is that ubuntu hasn t historically been one of the supported images for bdutil we thoroughly validate centos and debian images but not ubuntu images since they were only added as gce options in november 2014
you re going to have to dig into kafka and fix that topic so that it has a broker that is acting as leader
was able to make it runable thanks to thejas nair of hortonworks
unsatisfiedlinkerror is thrown when some lib couldn t be found or it was found but doesn t contain implementation of some function and thus native method can t be found
it looks like that extra is terminating the string from hive s perspective so it doesn t matter if it s valid json because it doesn t get a chance to pass it along to whatever is going to parse the json
add this line in hadoop env sh i have mentioned the path for hive as usr local hive since i have hive installed at that location
note you should not have instead you should have because if 2009 event have occurred once then it should have both first and last date
look at configuration documentation you will find get set and many specialized method depending on the raw type of the value you want to add
i solved the problem actually there was version incompetency so i change hadoop client 2 6 0 to 2 7 0
i wrote a custom signal handler and that helped me know that it was a segment fault error so i was doing something wrong with the pointers or the memory
the reason i couldn t get it done earlier is because i was changing this property by going to the file on the server and that did not work i guess because i m using cloudera distribution
for complete stability you d need to be able to re run the partition step if it has duplicate entries so you can guard against the occasional over sampling of the unbalanced keys but at that level of complexity you may as well look into the next solution
1 or 2 reducers will never generate this error since there can t be more than 1 split point and the loop will never execute
i suppose it all depends on what you really want to do with the duplicates here as to how you handle it
which is returned from execute on the other hand you can just use upserts instead and use operators such as setoninsert to only make changes where no duplicate existed so you basically look up the value of the field that holds the key to determine a duplicate with a query then only actually change any data where that key was not found and therefore a new document and inserted
depending upon x64 bit x32 bit system download the winutils exe file set your hadoop home pointing to it
set hive exec dynamic partition true set hive exec dynamic partition mode nonstrict this is because bydefault static partitioning is enabled which may create such issue which you are facing
if not then make sure you place the files in that directory and try querying again
testing code if you have some simple expression you want to test you can do the following to create a dual like table in hive where there is one column and one row you can do the following test an expression on this table like you would in sql beyond this it is a good idea to test your results on a subset of data as you have mentioned
then you can print your data into a text file or easily into an excel file or some other format you might prefer after you have done whatever additional transformations you want and review the results if you don t like a random subset you will have to build a query to target a subset you prefer
then print it to a file format you like as explained above excel as a file viewer may have limitations so something else may be preferable
since you dont have the permission to share the code you can try the following steps
this is required because the task may execute in any of the worker nodes
discovered my problem the pig partioner did not match cql3 and therefore the data was being parsed incorrectly
i managed to get rid of the issue by including the following dependency but it still doesn t make sense that this should depend on jdk1 8
due to this the resultset associated to the row are not releasing the lock and thus the error message
project common v2stuff v4stuff depending on how you deliver your project you may have a couple more submodules which assemble the final artifacts for each version of hadoop
each input key of the reducer corresponds to a unique email address so you don t need the results collection
each time the reduce method is called it is for a distinct email address so my suggestion is i am not sure what the objectmapper class does but i suppose that you need it to format the output
since it gives you out of memory error for heap space you might want to increase the java heap size of node manager
your issue can be explained in the stack trace here caused by exitcodeexception exitcode 24 file home hduser2 hadoop hadoop 2 6 0 etc hadoop must be owned by root but is owned by 1001 the entire path containing container executor cfg must be owned and writable only by root
you ran sh interpreter with the command use instead as you did in this automatically selects the script interpreter that may be different as the first line of start hbase sh says the difference between these two ways is explained here https askubuntu com questions 22910 what is the difference between and sh to run a script this solved the problem i had with i am using hbase 1 1 2 so the line may have changed
this is because you are using local storage location user hive warehouse for your hive metastore that conflicts with the defaultfs per hive
the way you run the test depends on how your project is built
first code should replicate to similarly last code would be once you have the fcode and lcode columns use case when statements for the result column criteria
regarding this possible differences are on rows with same values of by variables especially if the result is different
in sas i would pre sort data by id code result then use by id code in order to not be influenced by order of rows
since your condition for first and last on result is different i guess this is not a source of differences
i guess you could add another field as to detect last row with rownumdesc 1 so that you skip the join
i think the two programs above both include random selection of rows for groups with same values of id and code variables especially with same values of result
however the random aspect in sas code storage is based on physical order of rows while the row numbers randomness within a group will be influenced by the implementation of the function in the engine
because of that if run commands test e path 0 will not be true
i suspect a threading issue so i tried the below and it worked
this can be because of the lack of pydoop library in all the nodes
in that machine you have pydoop library
i see the actual problem as the insufficient memory allocated to the maptask container which causes java heap space error
the root cause is that when generating the java command line our spark uses single quote dxxxx to wrap the parameters
so the local file path that you mention will be no longer valid for oozie since its scope is on the cluster
maybe it s late but now i have known what caused this error
please share your code so that we can a better picture
you said but you also said thus you gave a jdbc connection url for the client server configuration of derby but the classpath you provided was for the embedded configuration of derby
and thus you received the error you can either change your classpath or you can change your jdbc connection url
if you want to use the client server configuration of derby switch your classpath to say since you need the jdbc client driver for this configuration
source so you can use manual script or job to clean the temp location with regular interval or you can cron a shell script with cleaning 30 or 60 days data
simply compile your program with latest api jar better compile you code entirely in the new environment with all latest jars from hadoop as well because hbase new versions are not compatible with hadoop old versions as well
the bigdata technology stack have many option based on type of data and the way it needs to be aggregated
maria dev sandbox learn hive s e set 2 dev null grep warehouse dir hive metastore warehouse dir apps hive warehouse because hive prints a lot of information to the stderr i added the 2 dev null output redirect to supress the stderr output from being written to the console
i faced exactly the same issue and the reason is the hive version
what s being copied is mrjob s entire python directory so that it can be unpacked on each of your nodes
the best way i found to handle this was to basically encode my name so that the space was mapped to a special character ie
just check the replication factor you are using this error occurs because there is a possibility that the replicas of a block may have different generation stamp values
it uses minimal memory like around 27 mb to run so you should be fine there
i would need more information about the query to know for sure but my guess is that the query you are running is a map only job thus not requiring any reducers
however now that you can not even start hbase i would suggest to download and start your own zookeeper server at the same address 127 0 0 1 2181 and try to start hbase again
rmr remove recursive which deletes both folder file rm is just remove which removes only file everytime you need to either change output path or delete and use the same since hdfs is worm write once read many model storage
either way there will be a directory to remove so no error
also note that if you changed the twitter code and bumped up the libraries it will cause this issue because flume also comes with its own twitter source
in that case either delete the twitter jars or better yet remove the flume s twitter jars from the classpath
you should instead wrap your string in a text object by saying return new text result
since downloading sequence file will give you header and other magic word in the binary file the way i avoid this problem is to transform my original binary file into base64 string and store it as text in hdfs and when downloading the encoded binary files i decode it back to my original binary file
if anybody have the same problem you can find out the reason here https help ubuntu com community ssh openssh configuring
so you can try changing public static class maxtemperaturereducer extends reducer avrokey avrokey nullwritable to public static class maxtemperaturereducer extends reducer avrovalue avrokey nullwritable since in the mapper you are writing avrokey as key and avrovalue as value
it may depend on hive version
now if each query appears to work why don t you try a workaround based on the divide and conquer approach or if hive is not smart enough to design an execution plan then let s design it ourselves e g
since it uses utf8 encoding the indexing inside a text is based on byte offset of utf8 encoded characters unlike in java string where the byte offset is at each character
its utf 8 code units f0 90 90 80 4 bytes following are the byte offsets when it is stored in text which is utf 8 encoded offset of u0041 0 offset of u00df 1 since previous utf 8 character occupied 1 byte character 41 offset of u6771 3 since previous utf 8 character occupied 2 bytes characters c3 9f offset of ud801 udc00 6 since previous utf 8 character occupied 3 bytes characters e6 9d b1 finally the last utf 8 character deseret capital letter long i occupies 4 bytes f0 90 90 80
because no such character exists in the string as per utf 8 encoding
hence when you query for offset of ud801 udc00 you get a proper answer of 6
at the end of exception there is a line like caused by java lang runtimeexception failed to create local dir data0 hadoop hbase local jars can you please check the permission whether user has permission to create the directory at the specified location or not
monal have ran the command stop all sh and ran the command ps ef grep i datanode and the command is still showing the results
you probably want also capital h instead of lowercase h since in lowercase it s 12 hour am pm time
try instead notice that yyyy mm dd hh mm ss is the default so you could just use hive uses of course java for date formats so you should check this http docs oracle com javase 7 docs api java text simpledateformat html
read the description of the command below you can execute this command as or both these commands should give you almost identical results
it works like this you provide a console application c c or whatever you have that accepts input from stdin processes it and writes its results to stdout
in your case you may want to implement the training and testing of an ann as mapper writing the evaluation results as output
you can either download and inspect all those results manually or provide a reducer that picks the best network and writes only that one to the final result data
if we parse through the syslog in that link we have a string like use this regular expression and find out the launcher id
that s because when yarn localizes the files for execution in containers it introduces a layer of symlink indirection
since both the main script and the module are physically in the same directory python will be able to load the module correctly
this question explains the issue in more detail how to import a custom module in a mapreduce job
testdata pythonappconf xml since we have set matchstring to foo and since our input file contains only a single record with key set to foo we expect the output of running the job to be a single line containing the value corresponding to key foo which is 1
taking it for a test run we do get the expected results
process py the command line invocation changes to specify an hdfs path in files and once again we see the expected results
thanks to chris nauroth for the answers he provided above
probably not the case here but make sure to compile the udf against the same version of hadoop and hive that you have in the cluster you should always check if info is null after the call to parse looks like the library uses a key meaning that actually gets data from an online service udger com so it may not work without an actual key
you should change the code to do that only once in the constructor like the following here s how to change it but to know for sure you have to look at the logs yarn logs but also you can look at the hive logs on the machine you re submitting the job on probably in var log hive but it depends on your installation
such a problem probably can be solved by steps overide the method udf getrequiredjars make it returning a hdfs file path list which values are determined by where you put the following xxx lib folder into your hdfs
this steps will result in a xxx jar and a lib folder xxx lib next to xxx jar put xxx jar and the folders xxx lib to your hdfs filesystem according to your code in step 0 create a udf using add jar the xxx jar hdfs path create function your function as qualified name of udf class try it
this is a very general pardigm so it means you can code in pretty much anything you want including python
select b t id from my table a lateral view json tuple a json t id result b as t id result where a year 2015 and a month 12 and b result true limit 10
finally figured out the reason i have to put real ip in core site xml originally i was using hdfs localhost 9000 or hdfs hadoop vm 9000 none is working only accepting local request but once i changed it to hdfs xxx xxx xx xx 9000 hadoop can accept remote requests
table permissions are usually retrieved from zookeeper so it may indicate a problem with the tserver connecting to zookeeper
unfortunately i don t see the hostname or the ip in the stack trace so you may have to check all the tserver logs to find it
this is a mismatch that inputsampler finds when it runs hence the message meaning that it was trying to find text as key based on your parametrization but it found longwritable instead
you can format coord nominaltime down to the second if you wish but in the coordinator therefore you must stuff the result into a configuration property to forward it to the workflow script
i got another way to do the same thing but takes a bit of effort since it requires the mapper and reducer files to be transferred to the hadoop cluster storage
assuming age is an integer this will work but it s a bad solution it s a bas solution because if name and job countain a quote that would break your code
you need to add your result variable in string quotes
this is caused by presto hive connector does not like the symlink tmp emr 4 2 and 4 3 is using for hive s3 staging directory you can use the configuration api to overwrite hive s3 staging directory and set it to mnt tmp like this
the link above gives examples but the exact details depend on your network configuration
since the entityid is in the rowkey you will presumably avoid hotspotting
then you can do a prefix range scan based on the desired state
since previous states are deleted you know that a scan for sn will not generally have records in state sn 1
since the delete and add cannot be done atomically there will be small windows
but since presumably your queries are executing asynchronously from your updates and they can be out of order you cannot guarantee a fixed time for complete consistency for the query execution anyway
i guess that the reason is that you always skip the first token and ask for the next two
ps2 you might also consider writing the key as intwritable or vintwritable based on your data and requirements slower to parse a string as int but faster to transmit to network and lower memory consumption
i have to use both escaped by and enclosed by so the correct command is for more information please see official documentation
the problem occurs due to the mysql environmental variables added in the system path
so it turns out although spark ui says it failed at saveashadoopdataset it was in fact failing at first step of the stage where saveashadoopdataset was the last step
to elaborate more spark defines stage boundaries based on sequence of narrow transformation or sequence of combined wide transformation and narrow transformation
since 2016 isn t done yet any data for 1 1 now would be in the 2016 bucket but it s not complete
is there need of multi node cluster to see a the effect of custom partitioner
this is not done in real time though as the processing and shuffling of data can be expensive depending on the data load
since you are using datastax enterprise the advantage is that you have built in connectors to both solr dse search to provide ad hoc queries and spark dse analytics to provide analytics on your data
since i don t know your exact reporting requirements it is difficult to give you a specific recommendation
this is because there are classes missing in your hadoop jar files
you also should check what libraries spark depends on
it seems to be related to the attempt at optimizing the following simplified script ideally if a was joined with d earlier then the data flowing through joins j1 and j2 could reduce and therefore speed up things
edit now that you ve added the query i can add more
what s happening is you re first joining all of the tables in a cross product and then keeping records based on your where clause rather than joining tables together selectively using an on clause
here s how i d re write your reducer based on what you ve given us this is totally untested next and more semantically you re performing a knn operation using a treemap as your datastructure of choice
while this makes sense in that it internally stores keys in comparative order it doesn t make sense to use a map for an operation that will almost undoubtedly be required to break ties
this is due to the fact that you can t have two instance of the same key
thus your algorithm is incapable of breaking ties
there are a few things you could do to fix that first if you re set on performing this operation in the reducer and you know your incoming data will not cause an outofmemoryerror consider using a different sorted structure like a treeset and build a custom comparable object that it will sort and then instead of your treemap use a treeset knnentry which will internally sort itself based on the comparator logic we just built above
but back to your original question you re getting an outofboundsexception because the index you re trying to access does not exist i e there is no in the input string
there is a jira open to enhance this behavior so that it would auto update but the eta of such a feature is unknown at this time
hive would be another option but in that case you would need to sqoop both tables from hbase into hive and then proceed from there within hive
i m not pasting it here directly because there are many ways to do it depending on how you create and use your cluster
the cause of the leader election taking too long was corrupt data on one of the 3 zookeeper servers
any context value is therefore related to an instance of its enclosing type reducer
ignore that for reducer since it s part of the hadoop code base
this problem is occuring because of 1
first ensure atleast 3 players come from the same state and same month you will have to get the set from the master table count the ids for each state month and filter the result where count id 3 you will have to then join the batting table with the above set group by month state and order by sum hits sum bats and get the first row
thus the ui you are seeing belongs to a different storm cluster
thus bin storm jar does not send the topology to any cluster but runs a local jvm i assume that bin storm blocks
since i am doing testing so gave all permission to hdfs superuser
if you re using the docker version of quickstart on macos the reason could be that docker desktop is not allocating enough memory
file has to be present in hdfs so that it can then add it to the distributed cache to each task node distributedcache getlocalcachefile basically gets all the cache files present in that task node
i might have downloaded the wrong one because it matters whether you download the 64 bit one vs the 32 bit one
since moving code mostly in mb s demands very less network bandwidth than moving data in gb s or tb s you no need to worry about data locality or network bandwidth
i will summarize your issue as well i would agree that the source code would likely make that impossible since all of the mapper reducer keys and values are text
looks your combiner is causing the issue
one possible cause is that you are hitting a timeout value before yarn assigns an applicationmaster
it may be due to memory issue
the reason why hbase data load is slow because of put operations
we then decided to load as hfileformat inorder to achieve this first understand your data then create a table with pre splitted regions process the input data set and write the results into hfileformat through a spark map reduce job finally load the data into hbase table by using hbase org apache hadoop hbase mapreduce loadincrementalhfiles
these few chunks should fit in memory you need to play with the configurations to get this right to summarize you will be able to do it but it would be faster if you had more memory cores so you can processes more things in parallel
this seems to be the relevant part of the error message caused by java io ioexception jar file usr hdp 2 4 2 0 258 hive lib ojdbc6 jar does not exist the missing jar seems to be an oracle jdbc driver
i assume you re using this to do the export bin hbase org apache hadoop hbase mapreduce export tablename outputdir versions starttime endtime as described on this hbase page http hbase apache org 0 94 book ops mgt html export looking at the source code for org apache hadoop hbase mapreduce export you can see it sets which aligns with your error the value is a result object could not find a deserializer for the value class org apache hadoop hbase client result so your map signature needs to change to mapper immutablebyteswritable result text text and you ll need to include the correct hbase library in your project so it has access to org apache hadoop hbase client result
jars present in the hbase home folder and hbase home lib to lib folder in oozie the reason it must be working in your command line is because hbase home environment must have already been setup
i cannot comment because i do not have 50 reputation yet but that might have to do with the configuration of the service behind port 8088 the vm probably got a small netmask from the virtual dhcp server which presumably covered the ip range of all other vms not including the host machine
if that had happened and the service was configured like many others to listen on all interfaces it would not react on requests and your connection would reach a closed port causing a connection refused error
the issue is because of the classname the driver classname should be fully qualified when setting in configuration as follows
files and directories that starts with underscore are considered hidden in mapreduce that s probably the reason of the observed behavior
the where clause is evaluated before the select clause so you can t use all dest geographic zone in where clause
this caused ioob exceptions in many cases
i have never seen calling this method before and it seems that you don t even need it as you don t store its results in any variable
then skip your map computations when this counter is equal to 1 the error message is shown 68 times maybe because it is shown once for each map task that can run at the same time as many as the available map slots in your cluster then those tasks are re executed each task twice until some of them fail causing the whole job to fail there is a threshold on how many tasks can fail before the whole job fails
though it is a moot point since you don t have 1 for 2 deflate has no apparent markers in the stream to identify block boundaries
how about select i removed the b columns because they are not needed
but since i found the solution i just wanted to post here so that someone can benefit
you will get the same result but there is a performance downgrade because of it
i ve made hadoop configuration object a bean because i need to inject it in one of the classes
it was because the driver and connection managers information was not specified in sqoop export statement
for a small dataset that fits in memory m r is usually worse than your traditional packages due to compromises made in the algorithm for scalability
logs in hadoop shows data from container allocation by yarn mapping reducing to the final result written
describe commands just prints columns of that view so it does not show if it s a view or not
although i m not sure what happened to the metastore uri it s defined in a hadoop conf file no shell env variables there that s because you have enclosed them in single quotes
i ll go ahead and assume your company isn t standing up hadoop outside of one of those distributions because enterprise support
reason being is that there are a few breaking changes in spark 2 0
this is typically a reason why people use strings in cases like this
a quick check to see if this is the problem would be to change this code to something like thus you create a new text each time
for some reason hadoop version 2 6 0 is not available
you re facing that error because hdfs cannot append the files when written from shell
that record writable could have a fixed schema like it contains intwritable text intwritable intwritable depending on you fields
you need to change red text key iterable intwritable values context context to reduce text key iterable intwritable values context context because of the name you aren t actually overriding the reduce method so it will be calling the default implementation in the reducer class which is effectively just writes out each key value which is what you seem to be seeing
the error only local python files are supported is most likely being thrown by spark because livy is appending an hdfs prefix to your file path by default
i had to cast my data avg is failing because loadusers age is being treated as string instead of int
the following is the proper way to execute so that worked and i got my output in the output folder
therefore one can use the tool sqoop
the following can be configured yarn scheduler minimum allocation mb yarn scheduler maximum allocation mb yarn scheduler increment allocation mb yarn scheduler minimum allocation vcores yarn scheduler maximum allocation vcores yarn scheduler increment allocation vcores all the following criteria must be satified they are per container except for yarn nodemanager resource cpu vcores and yarn nodemanager resource memory mb which are per nodemanager hence per datanode 1 yarn scheduler minimum allocation vcores yarn scheduler maximum allocation vcores yarn scheduler maximum allocation vcores yarn nodemanager resource cpu vcores yarn scheduler increment allocation vcores 1 1024 yarn scheduler minimum allocation mb yarn scheduler maximum allocation mb yarn scheduler maximum allocation mb yarn nodemanager resource memory mb yarn scheduler increment allocation mb 512 you can also see this helpful link https www cloudera com documentation enterprise 5 4 x topics cdh ig yarn tuning html
i don t think you will ever get exactly the same answer as r because r s percentile function most likely takes non integers also
therefore this should work worked for me at least
you want to access a class that is package private outside of it s package by implementing your own classloader that allow to break the protection rules of the jvm so you want to break the java language specification
your objective is to get all same keys into their own reducer so that you can sum the numbers
this code assumes sites isn t going to be large so an improvement would be adding some checking around its size since we re putting it in memory and the following context write will be expanding the data
to convert nulls to zeroes use nvl col 0 or coalesce col 0 function depending on your hive version coalesce should work for all
this is an open issue in apache sqoop
go to the nifi folder and check under bin folder nifi sh is there or not and run below command in linux because you are running on linux machine not windows so don t run batch file here
for example hive 0 14 gives different results for
pig is a language that i ve had limited experience with so i ll reserve commentary
the reason the first put operation to data data txt is not working is likely that you do not have a folder data in your hdfs yet
the guava library actually used when running in the cluster is an older one that hadoop depends on and is provided when the driver executor starts
it comes first in the classpath so this is why the more recent version your code depends on is not used thus the nosuchmethoderror
it uses the following spark config parameters most likely you will get in other kind of troubles down the road as i did java lang linkageerror because of the classloaders that are used in this case
the solution that helped me was to shade the guava version that my code is using so that it no longer conflicts with the one that hadoop depends on
the reason the core site xml file was not being read in is because of the hadoop s file structure
it is because i was using stream processing
batch processing works to push data to s3 but stream processing doesn t because of how s3 stores data as a key value store and new data can t be appended only replaced
if the hive command returns success fail return code depending upon the status of the execution you can directly use it in the if clause as i have double quoted all the variables for the shell to expand it on execution
as i was using cloudera virtual machine for spark so the file readme md was not present at path hdfs quickstart cloudera 8020 user cloudera readme md
based on what you say the output should be only 0 s in this the max value in the reducers are 0 or no output all values less than 0
edit2 based on your answer i would try this and reducer pretty simple to emit 1 record per customer
the probable cause it fs defaultfs is set to hdfs so it tries to work in that directory
since you re using apache maven for your build you use the apache maven assembly plugin or the apache maven shade plugin
did the some changes in my properties file like below log4j rootlogger fatal file log4j appender file org apache log4j dailyrollingfileappender log4j appender file file idn home sshivhar sanjeev poc log application new log4j appender file datepattern yyyy mm dd log log4j appender file layout org apache log4j patternlayout log4j appender file layout conversionpattern d yyyy mm dd hh mm ss 5p c 1 l m n i changed the logging level to fatal because i was looking for only those messages which i wrote inside my udf
because logging messages has below priority level trace debug info warn error fatal if i changed the fatal to info it will also write the unwanted warn and error messages into the file which comes from hive shell like mapper reducer information
you should consider that the udf jar file is copied over the cluster and exected by each node hence if the path is valid and the user have permission to write a log file is written in each machine
it s worth noting that it s not standard for a jar but since it s supported in hadoop here it is how do i put all required jar files in a library folder inside the final jar file with maven
at last i suggest that you use maven shade plugin to build an executable jar fat jar http maven apache org plugins maven shade plugin examples executable jar html it will attach the dependency jars to the result shade jar by itself
the table inside the from clause should have a name and because of that reason nested query inside from clause without alias throws error
i had the same problem and found out that the cause was a way how nodes connect to each other
this is because they default hadoop configuration does not require authentication
the entire filesystem 43766 blocks being marked as corrupt can be either due to removal of the dfs datanode data dir folder s entirely or changing its value in hdfs site xml
and for the permissiondenied exception run the hive queries as either hdfs or hive user since root user does not have write access to hdfs
you should not delete your partitions in hive table in that way
in most of the cases the unknown ports are blocked from the firewall end for security reasons and you need to do a dynamic for forwarding for viewing the url
found the root cause of this issue
we don t know exactly what happened but the cluster was an emr cluster with m1 medium s since we were just testing
well i didn t think to click on the error log outputs since i was changing the permissions so i assumed a permission error and previous failures were permission errors but after looking at the error logs they were saying out of memory
the table is not getting created and hence the second statement is throwing table not found error
i have got the same error and solved it for several days with with the following step open the file etc hosts since your error message is does not contain a valid host port authority slave 1 60805 there should be a value as salve 1 in file etc hosts for example 127 0 0 1 salve 1 or 127 0 1 1 salve 1 you need to remove the character or for this hostname and then try again
the other so question you cited in comments merely makes the same claim without citation to any source for it
i suggested in comments that you might return an error code for duplicate requests and indeed you can but that behavior might surprise clients because they may expect get requests to be idempotent
as an alternative you could consider deferring service on the duplicate requests until the computation is finished and then serving identical responses to all the requests based on the same computation results
the original problem was caused by the use of outdated and deprecated hbase client jars and classes
i have confronted the same error message however according to my research the root cause is that the class htable can not be constructed explicitly
and create a group supergroup for all these superusers so that group level access privileges can be given for the files if required
this could happen due to multiple reason either the corresponding jar wont be available which is the hivejdbcdriver jar with the right version eg hive jdbc 1 2 1 jar or sometimes you may to use hive jdbc 1 2 1 standalone jar depending upon on how your usecase is in the libraries folder or m2 repository
or it could also be the jar may not be added in your classpath add an entry for this jar in your classpath file depending upon how your application is built
the error is due to the csv header in the file
since this is only one line the mapper processing the split containing the header would throw exceptions but they are not potential enough to kill the job
based on your answre it looks like you are missing some dependencies in your jar file
the actual reason for the failure is due to the below error
caused by java lang nosuchmethoderror com fasterxml jackson databind node objectnode
i am not sure of the reason
the query was failing due to incorrect encoding of the variable stablename
implementation of absolute is optional as specified by the interface of resultset absolute link the implementation for absolute is optional especially when the result set type is type forward only
workaround in my case the result set comes from a spark thrift server sts so i guess it is indeed forward only
the most common reason for this problem is because you have columns names with key words for example name a column key or order just a dummy example try import the table like this query select from db table where conditions
that is because a filesystem instance is permanently tied to a specific usergroupinformation when it is created
since you created the instance inside a doas running as proxy user joy the subsequent operations on that filesystem keep executing as joy
your setup with striim1 appears to be working fine because it authenticated as striim1 the real user and then executed as joy the effective user
the consequence of this is that when the namenode executes the call it will execute as if the user was not a member of any groups
here is what was needed to make it work because we use hbase to store our data and this reducer outputs its result to hbase table hadoop is telling us that he doesn t know how to serialize our data
create new namenode and datanode directories and modify hdfs site xml accordingly
this is because you use spark 1 x to compile codes but run your application in spark 2 x cluster
you can update pom xml to use the same version of your spark cluster and probably need to update your codes as well because 2 x and 1 x are not compatible
join with union ed bigger dataset also may work with very high parallelism depending on your settings bytes per reducer for example optimizer also may rewrite query plan
you can notice the changes below notice here the output of map is written using context write now coming onto your reducer some things will change because of the changes i made in the mapper
also since your number of ratings will always be an integer you don t need to convert it to text use parseint and then convert to text again
wholetextfiles puts whole file into a single entry so it doesn t make a lot of sense to save it in ignite
however while you are printing the data to the screen depending on your client assuming you use hive client you see the results as broken because it is likely that the server sends the data to the client in clear text
jdk 7 seems to have recognized the weakness of using a boolean return code for these operations because it fails to distinguish the specific reason for failure
the current method signature is unlikely to change even for the better for backward compatibility reasons
since you are using the identity mapper and there is no reducer specified the job s output is specified by the mapper
the identity mapper outputs whatever was input so it receives longwritable text tuples as input and outputs the same longwritable text tuples as output
this causes the error in your image if you remove the call to job setoutputkeyclass then the error will no longer occur
in my case i used to achieve that in two ways through dstream one way load tmp data contain 3 days unique data see below receive batch data and do leftouterjoin with tmp data do filter on step2 and output new unique data update tmp data with new unique data through step2 s result and drop old data more than 3 days save tmp data on hdfs or whatever repeat above again and again another way create a table on mysql and set unique index on event id receive batch data and just save event id event time whatever to mysql mysql will ignore duplicate automatically
since home srv hadoop data txt file is on local file system your pig x local is working
bad data is always something that needs to be accounted for
add is fixed but drop rename change are still crippled thanks to and another related fix as of hive 2 1 1 for change to be continued
the problem was due to a bad hue ui design when i issued the above two queries it takes too long longer than the set timeout on the ui to get a response back so simply the ui doesn t reply anything or gives a timeout reminder
also those two queries essentially making two rpc calls so they timed out
then i changed to use below query the difference is that i added a count which turns this query into a map reduce job thing thus no timeout limit and then it returns the result that i wanted
or if you somehow can maintain track of what all ids got updated since last import then let s say you know ids 7 3 4 and 8 got updated since last import you can use the minimum of updated ids and use as last value
so your config will be incremental append check column id last value 3 merge key id where merge key id will tell sqoop to merge the new incremental data with old based on id column
if you really want to dynamically decide whether to install an extra or not based upon inspecting the libs avail on the source machine you can do it using a post install script or just adding the logic for generating install requires argument directly into the setup py
here you can read how to calculate opportune value of resources for executors and driver https blog cloudera com blog 2015 03 how to tune your apache spark jobs part 2 your job runs in client mode because in client mode drive can use all available resources on the node
therefore the used userpricipal in file etc security keytabs user keytab is present on this machine
about the patch https paste apache org jjqz in that answer use 0 7 where it shows 0 7 snapshot
if you need to do operations on columns so you won t reduce the final size of the dataframe then after operating on each chuck store the result in a file
approach 1 to achieve this you can run the first query and store the result in one variable and then execute the query
hence you need to include hbase common jar in hadoop classpath
i can t see what actually causes the loadclass from the stack trace snippet but it appears that the class doesn t actually exist in the version 2 8 1 of hadoop common you re using
is consuming the rest of the text therefore everything after the first line is null is there any other hadoop ecosystem tool that will allow me to format or map logs fields according to the table fields the logs before load them to hive table
i was lucky that the hibernate code there was just for simple db query session createsqlquery not serious orm so the change was relatively easy
this is the reason why you are getting 404 because the topology is not being deployed
this is my new spring factories probabilly it doesn t needs all the dependencies so i will check it and update my answer in the future
the string in the case clause case table name in will never expand because present under the single quotes
it will not throw an error because you are trying to match a literal string without any expansion done
i overwrite out las each time in hdfs so that i don t have take too much space
thus it couldn t find it because it actually did not exist
filter k get 0 can be applied for get final result
now that all the typos are fixed it s easier to see what you re doing
i m not sure why the error doesn t think you have 4 columns but anyway don t use the since you have a partition column of the same name as the column in the source table
yeah i have tried to debug your code the error was in your map class so initialise value 1 so that it will return value 1 for each word
because when you call sc textfile hdfs path to filewithmissingblock spark doesn t do anything lazy evaluation i e read file from your filesystem
you have the class on the build path so it compiles but apparently you don t have it in the classpath of the running binary which is why it doesn t run
you can put a cron job or etl workflow according to your incremental refresh frequency and call sqoop exec jobname in that
it could be due to signature version incompatibility between regions
the value is the line of text so a text writable object
yes it should though since we can t see the code at the moment hard to say what you ve written as output
i think you have to do it manually since you are using community version
since version 2 hadoop changed its packaging so instead of declaring a dependency on hadoop core you should use the hadoop client which is a metapackage that aggregates all the necessary dependencies for you
let me share the real cause and how it got resolved
on eclipse it was fine because each jar had the corresponding file but in the uber jar one might have overridden others causing the file scheme to not get recognized
since your error permissions do not match the output of the file system sounds like you downloaded spark but didn t configure it therefore it s defaulting to local disk first try using spark shell alone from cdh installation to run a smoketest
i don t see a reason why they would remove it from the installation
you downloaded the version that includes hadoop based on the end of the filename
since you say you set it up on your cluster you should use the download option without precompiled hadoop
and unless it s actually a cloudera parcel don t place it in that opt cloudera parcels directory
according to the maven docs for standard directory layout the default sourcedirectory is src main java and since your project structure is src main scala the classes are not getting compiled
when you run spark submit in the cluster mode what happens is the driver runs on a different machine than the client so the jar which you have provided in the spark submit script needs to be placed on the driver s class path like this so you can try the below script as follows
then change dictory to the hive home bin execute schematool initschema dbtype mysql and the problem is solved the error due to the metastore in mysql is too late i have set the metastore in standby environments i turn to the cluster environment later but the metastore is previous so i can create table in hive not in sparksql
the problem was with a ctas create table as operation that preceded the failing insert command due to an inappropriate close of the file system
you have no node managers running therefore you have no vcores or memory to compute with
i figured it out it was because yarn nodemanager local dirs was set to only a single hdd on each node in the cluster
refer https spark apache org docs latest streaming programming guide html input dstreams and receivers if you are using an input dstream based on a receiver e g
hence when running locally always use local n as the master url where n number of receivers to run see spark properties for information on how to set the master
a skiptext line was found and the job is implemented to throw a task ending exception in that case
so that all the dependencies are available now
since it is executing properly from terminal and not in crontab try loading user bash profile in the script instead of bin bash ie change to usually bin bash is included in bash profile and it will have user specific configurations as well
this obviously leads to wrong reading and consequently to the exception you see
that said i believe that you don t need a comparator at all since the default writablecomparator does exactly what yours does calls the compareto method for the pair of objects that is passed to it
edit the compareto method that is called is comparing your keys not your values so it compares text objects
this is because you might have not declared the collection items termination clause in the creation of the table
you re having trouble because columns is not meant for what you re trying to do
i can t replicate your output because i get an error as soon as i try this line you don t need to use the dot operator to refer to these fields e g
sum occ ngram because they are not nested in a tuple or bag
fwiw i personally don t find the reason for putting hadoop in containers
and for the namenode you must have a replicated fsimage editlog because the container could be placed on any system
because apache hadoop is not currently supported on ipv6 networks
see https wiki apache org hadoop hadoopipv6 edit etc sysctl conf net ipv6 conf all disable ipv6 1 net ipv6 conf default disable ipv6 1 net ipv6 conf lo disable ipv6 1 reload sysctl p check result sysctl net ipv6 conf all disable ipv6 sysctl net ipv6 conf default disable ipv6 sysctl net ipv6 conf lo disable ipv6 start hadoop i just guess
by default the buffer is flushed after writing 10000 records so you must have somewhere configured gora buffer write limit to 60000 at core site xml or mapred site xml or code
it is not important since it is at info level
re arranging that you get yyyymm 2 88 if the month is 1 or 2 the better idea may just be to reshape your data so that you actually have a real date field and just use add months arealdate 2 edit if your actual issue is generating the yyyymm value for two months ago then deduct the 2 months before you use the year and month functions
due to a quirk in java for equivalent dates date equals timestamp returns true but timestamp equals date returns false
i did not traced the cause but i know that switching to the overloaded method accepting an inputstream did work you wrote that if you add the xmls to your jar resources solves the problem it is because by default configuration class looks for two xml files in your class path and tries to load them
hdfs does not exist on a single server or is a local filesystem therefore scp is not the right tool to copy from it directly your options include ssh to remote server use hdfs dfs copytolocal in order to pull files from hdfs use scp from your computer to get the files you just downloaded on the remote server or configure a local hadoop cli using xml files from remote server use hdfs dfs copytolocal directly against hdfs from your own computer or install hdfs nfs gateway mount an nfs volume on your local computer and copy of files from it
for this reason i actually avoid this functionality but curious to know your experience with this
to understand how it works run the inner query and look at the results
since oozieclient is a wrapper over this api something like this should work
but asf spark releases don t work with hadoop 3 x yet due to some outstanding issues
here is a related question it looks like your json is also an array so what s written there will apply for you too
it s not because spark wants hadoop to be installed or it just wants that particular file
please stick to that as a first approach since that would yield list library related issues
as bryanbende said you are getting a java net connectexception connection refused so it seems to be something related to security configuration in the hadoop machine and not related to nifi itself try to connect with a hadoop client
thanks to cricket 007 for clarification
you cannot sort on a text field you can but the results wouldn t make sense however you can sort on a keyword field so the following query will work
check the definition https www cloudera com documentation enterprise 5 8 x topics impala decimal html decimal 12 9 means 12 digits with 9 digits after the decimal point so 3 digits before
what it does is it will give you list of all the applications with their respective application id s name user state tracking url etc so you can drill down what you need
at the very least hdfs dfs getmerge is the one minimalist way to get data from hdfs to local however hadoop typically stores many tb worth of data in the ideal cases and if you re using anything smaller then dumping those results into a database is typically the better option than moving around flatfiles
using scala below is one way to move files from one folder to the other folders based on the file names
its due to speculative execution in hadoop
in addition when you enable kerberos in yarn you have to stop yarn so any formatting that is done is done before jobs are running again
there are a few ways depending on how you deploy your job standalone add the jar containing filesystem implementation to the lib directory cluster manual add the jar containing filesystem implementation to the lib directory of your zip or image or whatever
the workflow in mr is like this each key value data type must match your error show caused by java io ioexception type mismatch in value from map expected org apache hadoop io doublewritable received recordwritable is caused by you have setcombiner job setcombinerclass joinsumreducer class the combiner output isn t match your reducer you can remove this line and try again
because secondly the problem is that you did care about your combiner input and outputs
spark does mini batches on the orders of seconds at a minimum where the other frameworks operates on even smaller time frames rdd is a spark concept and spark leverages hadoop libraries to perform its tasks so that statement is false
since you are working with rdd s and no df s and you have date strings with simple date checking the following non complicated way for an rdd
since the 4th column is in the iso expected format you can simply use the below rdd step
check this out the gave the below result hope this answers your question
if the hive mapred mode is set to strict then hive will not allow to do full table scans and few other risky operations like cross joins etc depending on the version of hive you are using these settings also affect the number of partitions that can be scanned by a single query hive metastore limit partition request or hive limit query max table partition
you need to create empty folders like etc based on your services selected in cloudera manager
because cloudera doesn t create the log directories it just creates the file you can test it by doing a global search in cloudera manager with var log and you will find a lot of log directory names
the synchronization between sentry permissions and hdfs acls is one way that is the sentry plugin on the namenode will apply sentry permissions along with hdfs acls so that hdfs enforces access to hive table data according to sentry s configuration even when being accessed with other tools
thus hdfs access control is a means to enforcement of policies defined in sentry in such a case
this is mainly because i use other tools that also modify these files
i was using native orc library for orcstruct and hive ql io orc orcserde this caused the exception
1 when i tried to read the data which was imported in hdfs using sqoop it gives an error because of following reasons a sequence file is all about key value pair
i don t think that the b point is the main reason of that error but i am very much sure that a point is the real culprit of that error
in the hql file it should be fields terminated by and comments should start with in hql file not also this seems incorrect and causing exception hql create import table fct latest values hql have a look at this example see here for more details
i made a change to my dag code regarding the file location for organization only and this is how my hiveoperator looks like now thanks to panov st who helped me in person to identify my issue
on centos in that case trying this might help you also check https community hortonworks com questions 176262 failed to specify servers kerberos principal name html
impala doesn t recognize skip footer line count so it is effectively ignored
it may be that spark submit succeeded because wasbs is supported via a different mechanism than hadoop s libraries or using a bundled and newer version of hadoop
one day retention period of tmp maybe too small because normally hive or other map reduce tasks can run more than one day though it depends on your tasks
hiveserver should remove temp files but when tasks fail or aborted the files may remain also it depend on hive version
better to configure some retention because when there is no space left in tmp everything stops working
the port number for hadoop 3 x is 9870 so localhost 9870 should work
some pre existing or just installed packages seem to lead to intermittent problems inconsistencies
i do not have the password to user hive because hive is not a regular user in hdp sandbox
error tool importtool import failed cannot convert sql type 2005 3 columns in source are having 2005 and nvarchar added them in map column java resolved this issue 3 org apache avro file datafilewriter appendwriteexception org apache avro unresolvedunionexception not in union null long 1 this is causing due to using in select query so modified sqoop query as sqoop import connect jdbc con username user1 query select col1 data col2 data col3 from table where conditions target dir target path m 1 map column java data col1 string data col2 string data col3 string as avrodatafile
when a task fails may be because the node that runs this job failed or was removed the task is rerun on another available node
so the issue stemmed from modifying the hue ini file before running the install
i must have had a typo in the modified version thus causing the parse error above
as per my understanding it doesn t look like it s possible to have 2 check columns when doing incremental imports so the only way we can manage to get this done is with 2 separate imports incremental import with the insert date as check column for first time records incremental import with the updated column as check column for updated records
i don t know why you would do that personally i would just create a cf1 column family and then a username column but it depends on your use case
that being said you re having troubles because that feature is not available in the version of hbase you re using
the stringio is not expecting a list it is expecting a string and therefore you have to restore the previous document structure from your list
you don t actually need mapreduce for this problem because you have all the data for each year available on each line and you don t need to compare between lines
problem solved it was because of zookeeper configuration in core site xml
you need to run with and then change your code to be because args 0 is the class name
first none of your queries have a from clause so all should generate syntax errors
if thats the case hive has partition column as date so that you can query the data for each day easily
it depends on your final use cases
since there is one less layer in it
since spark does not allow to update or delete data from hdfs
in that case both your approaches will be difficult to implement
either you can go with hive managed table and do update delete using hql only supported in hortonwork hive version or you can go with nosql database like hbase or cassandra so that spark can do upsert delete easily
this is clear indication of scala jar library mismatches which hive using since you are using incompatible scala changes for hive with spark option
tez doestnt use spark and scala thats the reason its working fine
thats the reason you are gettting this is very common issue when you are using hive with spark as execution engine steps
3 now change hive execution engine to point to spark in hive site xml which you are already aware doing another option is using softlinks like below example link jar files now we make soft links to certain spark jar files so that hive can find them
because of s3 inconsistency side effects the above error will appear when running in local mode
thus the uids did not sync and caused problems with hdfs nfs
use userdel and groupdel to remove all the ambari service users and groups then recreate all the groups across the cluster then recreate all the users across the cluster may need to specify uid if nodes have other users not on others restart the hdp services hopefully everything should still run as if nothing happend since hdp should be looking for the literal string not the uids for the last parts can use something like clustershell eg
after logging in with this new user i have the following output for the command that caused me some troubles moreover i noticed that processes created by start yarn sh were not listed in the output of jps while using java 11
cast implicitly is good idea if not possible to cast the result of cast is null
you place groups in proper order to get yyyy mm dd because it is not possible to understand which format are you using mm dd yyyy or dd mm yyyy
you are missing the type specification in the method signature so it will be considered to be a generic object and not your concrete type
well as far as this things are working on to the next set of problems i made for myself lol
or it has a memory leak which causes it to exceed it s container size and gets killed
based on the quotation used for query in query option we need to use either conditions or conditions as shown below
since you used double quotes conditions must be used to avoid substitution
when using multiple mappers selected data will be transferred parallelly by all the mappers after splitting based on the split by clause and substituting in place of conditions
since this is an external table i can add drop date partitions at will without affecting the underlying data
i can even make this part of my etl job where each time new data is added i add that partition to the external table and then drop a partition from a week ago resulting in this rolling window of 1 weeks data being made available to this user group without having to duplicate a load of data to a separate location
instead use table ensure the version is in keeping with your hbase deployment you should depend on org apache hbase hbase client version no need for any other hbase dependencies and use the following methods
you re correct in that everything in the memstore is now in hfiles but until a compaction takes place the deleted row will still exist albeit marked for deletion in the new second hfile
in your example it s set to name password so the name is treated as a watermark
if you need the results with multiple columns more than what needs to be counted you can create a temporary table with only the columns those are counted and join with the original table
use max analytic function and filter by it result
it is mostly due to yarn scheduler capacity maximum applications limit are hit
the mapreduce job fails because it is unable to access hdfs since there are 0 datanode s running and 0 node s are excluded in this operation
and from the datanode logs it is understood that the datanode daemon is unable to register itself with the hdfs cluster due to incompatible clusterids
to be able to use the underlying filesystem native support based on the operating system has to be added
it will result in 200x20 4000 files
because the data is being distributed randomly between reducers each reducer receives all partitions data and creates files in every partition
it can be failing for many reasons please follow this link to track the log to see why the process is failing then you could see something like this clik in logs and you should be able to see and you could explore why the process is failing
through my continuous attempts i found a solution but i still do not know the reason
this is because table data is being stored in the location no matter how you put the files inside that location
both queries are using the same number of mappers which is expected and single final reducer which is also expected because you need single scalar count result
final reducer needs to aggregate partial results again to get final result it can be much less data than in the first case
if you have 32 tasks and 4 executors and 7 have run and 4 are running with 21 tasks waiting in that stage then if one of the 4 fails more times than spark task maxfailures after being re scheduled then the job will stop and no more stages will be executed
this same issue also result in unable to run msck repair command
please add the below dependencies with your pom xml and give a try and it should work since org apache hadoop hdfs distributedfilesystem class is as part of hadoop hdfs client 3 3 0 dependency in reference https repo1 maven org maven2 org apache hadoop dependency updated pom xml of yours so please give a try and let me know if you can proceed with the spark run
root cause was the conflicting old version of same jar file left in hive lib directory
hence it was not picking the new jar files and rather refering old one
thanks to igordvorzhak providing the command hadoop classpath glob to check if the gcs connector hadoop3 latest jar can be found
when it is set to false hive will spawn a yarn job to read through the data and provide the count results
it is usually time consuming based on the amount of data since this is not a direct fetch from the statistics stored in hive metastore
so if we want the correct statistics to be returned in the results when the property hive compute query using stats is set to true we need to make sure the statistics for the table is updated
looks like a situation where the spark code calls path suffix something and because the root path has no parent an npe is triggered long term fix file jira on issues apache org against hadoop provide a patch with test for fix suffix to downgrade properly when called on root path
do both of these option 2 should avoid other surprises about how tables are created committed etc some of the code may fail because an attempt to delete the root of the path here s3a some bucket won t delete the root will it
put differently root directories have odd semantics everywhere most of the time you don t notice this on a local fs because you never try to use as a destination of work get surprised that rm rf is different from rm rf subdir etc etc
spark hive etc were never written to use as a destination of work so you get to see the failures
further reading how s3a writes data to s3 on hadoop 3 2 1 you can tell s3a to buffer in heap or bytebuffer so not use local disk at all
please update this post which whatever worked so others can make use your findings
the hierarchichal view that one sees is due to the gsutil tool that makes naming work the way users would expect
it has a simple and flexible architecture based on streaming data flows
as already mentioned the hadoop is the answer cause it s exactly made for such kind of large data
this doesn t really help because your full node is still full when you bring it back online
this will just result in another exception like output path already exists
the micro second timestamp values are larger than the millisecond timestamp values so your updates are being ignored
basically yours algorithms should not be dependent on whether the combine function is called since its meant to be just an optimization
the error that you got is because the fetch phase is unable to get the fetch list
for example you can call a constructor of class number because you know the class
extends number because the constructors are not defined at compile time
extends number because you don t know the type of the second list
the client side is calculating the inputsplits so it can be possible that when having large number of input files for each job the client machine gets a lot of load
i guess you re having the default fifo scheduler so you won t benefit from submitting all 200 jobs at a time either
then you can sort the keys that the reducer gets based on the first part of the pair the position and you should get back the lines in the same order
most of hadoop s internal communication is done over plain http so i can t think of a reason that ssh might be involved
when a map reduce task is due to run the scheduler picks a free map reduce slot which ever is available it may may not be the same machine from the previous run to run the task
according to the mailing list post linked from your question the java lang runtimeexception error in configuring object exception is caused by the example s dependencies not being on the tasktracker s classpath
in the valueaggregatorjob the following check is done if textinputformat literal string is not specified as an argument then the input format is defaulted to sequencefileinputformat so the huckfinn txt not a sequencefile error
hadoop is written in java so there should be a way use the o a h mapreduce job submit and o a h mapreduce job waitforcompletion methods
this was causing the classcastexception
ever since it has been in the core jar
there are different orders since not all listed products are dependent
avro is not directly dependent on hadoop it is serialization library
i would say that the deployment is done based on primary requirement and based on requirement you will choose what other components are needed
hadoop components depend on choice for example you setup just 1 you still can run mapreduce jobs while coping your data to hdfs
at the same time you decided to connect this hadoop cluster with sql server sql azure so you can import data from sql server sql azure to hdfs
and so on depend on your requirement you either create a list what is needed and setup in your cluster clusters
since text implements writable this will resolve your first two error messages
this is because hadoop will use reflection to instantiate an instance writable values as it serializes them across the network between the map reduce phases
i think you have a tiny bit of a mess here for the default no arg constructor the reason that i see this as a mess is because if you don t assign to taggedwritable data a valid instance of whatever your wrapped writable values are you will get a nullpointerexception when this data readfields in is invoked in taggedwritable readfields datainput
since it s a general wrapper you should probably make taggedwritable a generic type and then use reflection to assign to taggedwritable data in the default no arg constructor
thus all of these should be replaced by their old api equivalents
in your code catids only has two fields elementid and catid and you are trying to access categoryids in the second line so it won t work
here is my workflow xml modified you may need to modify this a bit more depending on the inputs and outputs of your map reduce job
it should be due to the memory limitation imposed by hadoop that caused the command cannot load successfully
i havent tested these solutions but try adding something like this in your job configuration the above may be abolete so you can also try the following with user set as hadoop code from http hadoop apache org common docs r1 0 3 secure impersonation html
but distributed modes are important for large scale since anyway one day you will hit the scalability limit of a single machine
with distributed slaves this gets even slower because all servers share the same hardware
in short i faced this problem because there were multiple installations of hadoop in the university cluster
the reason for hadoop daemons not starting is because it is not able to write to certain files that have root privilege
the problem occurred because our university s system administrator had installed hadoop as a root user so when i started my local installation of hadoop the root installation configuration files were getting priority over my local hadoop configuration files
this might be caused by old api and new api
i used job waitforcompletion true which caused spark on hbase to crash when using saveasnewapihadoopfile a you should not wait for your job since it is using the old hadoop api instead of the new api
since the shell is jruby based you can have here ruby commands as well similarly in java construct a filterlist
i d start like this i don t have much knowledge of date time values in pig so i ll leave how to do conversion from time string to timeslot to you
the field delimiter was being confused with the delimiter used for the map i also looked into the source code of the pigstorage function and confirmed the parsing logic source code thus since pig splits fields by the delimiter it causes the parsing of fields to be confused with the separator used for the map
i would suggest to identify what exactly input file or its split cause the problem
i don t know so much about your applications but your installation is small 3 machines and doesn t seem to be in production so you can actually manually restart the master namenode
this will build a jar that contains all your necessary dependencies and you won t have to worry about classpath issues when you add dependencies to your hadoop job because you are shipping out a single jar
try specifying the classpath explicitly so instead of hadoop jar iris jar edu iris seq csvtosequencefile iris data iris seq try something like java cp
since your mapper is static it has no instance of myprog to refer to
when running distcp command do not use hdfs for the source path use hftp for the source path while hftp for the destination path since hftp is read only you will need write access to the destination path so the command looks like hadoop distcp hftp hadoop namenode cluster1 hbase hftp hadoop namenode cluster2 hbase
when running distcp commnad use hftp as source and hdfs as destination since hftp is read only
as a result it infinitely delegates run to itself
this problem is tracked with below jira https issues apache org jira browse sqoop 2145 the fix of this jira has been included in cdh since version 5 4 0
i say trying because pig error messages are often quite cryptic
here is what you re doing right now but you really don t need to write 5 a or 2 b in this case 1 time would be enough since you only care about uniques
so instead of counting the uniques in the reducer you could directly reduce a lot of overhead by making sure you only send each value once this would effectively reduce the network bandwidth and the shuffle will be much simpler since there will be less keys to sort
you may catch exception in both mapper and reducer and inside the catch block have a counter like the following if the exception message is something you would have expected and also the counter s value is acceptable then you can very well go ahead with the results or else investigate the logs
since here cost of clusters are at stake i think we are better off catching excpetion instead of specific exceptions
though there may be side effects to it such as your code might be run on entirely wrong input and but for the catch it would have failed much earlier
dse will make sure a full copy of your dataset is replicated to whichever set of nodes you designate as analytics so it s generally a non issue
the last one is to exclude log4j transitive dependencies of hadoop if both project use maven but there is no guarantee on the result
note that you d still need a reducer to handle the edge cases where related keys were handles by different mappers since in hbase keys are ordered on disk you d only get that at the end begining of a split
looking into the implementation i saw that calling the map step with one scan results in exactly one mapper used
taking your own example if you do you are binding x and y to the output of the query and hence it works
remember the x and y inside queryx definition are only for that query and they are not automatically available to where ever you are using that queryx as data srouce and hence you need to explicitly bind them as shown above
lzo is gpl licensed so it can t be shipped with hadoop unlike snappy which is bsd based you can build lzo from https github com toddlipcon hadoop lzo or download from https code google com p hadoop gpl packing
so in that case you need to load the data in the table
to do this add a new line into pg hba con that has the following information start postgresql server use chkconfig utility to ensure that your postgresql server will start at a boot time you can use the chkconfig utility to verify that postgresql server will be started at boot time for example step 2 install the postgres jdbc driver before you can run the hive metastore with a remote postgresql database you must configure a jdbc driver to the remote postgresql database set up the initial database schema and configure the postgresql user account for the hive user
you could automate the task with the following sql script you can verify the connection from the machine where you ll be running the metastore service as follows step 4 configure the metastore service to communicate with the postgresql database change the ip of the aws amazon master server or your master server don t use dns name in the file search for and change to the correct ip that is your master hadoop server where u are running cloudera manager also every link in that file that is not correctly write to the hadoop master cloudera manager connector you will have to change to the correct ip after all this just get back to the autoinstall of cloudera manager and run again and it will be all good that it all the installation that you have to work around our contract cloudera support that s their business all this it works fine for me when i have this problem in de cloudera cdh 4 x with sorl regards
as stated in hdfs 2457 and hdfs 2396 hftp scheme doesn t support seek operation so this error is expected
with reserved instances you will have your own cluster always up and administered by you so there is no time lost setting up shutting down your cluster this behaves like a regular hadoop cluster
what i ve been doing in the past couple years is use an ec2 cluster on reserved instances that is always up and all the jobs are running on it but for some jobs that are very large and that couldn t fit on my cluster i run them on emr where i can choose how many nodes i want and since these are large jobs the time to setup shutdown the cluster is small in comparison to the total runtime
the exception is caused by the following lines in the source the actual npe is throw in the final line as jobtoken is null
possibly because your cluster is running in local mode
reasons 1 import export time
i know it has been a while since the question was posted but i would like to post for other users who may find useful
you manage files directly using hive table commands firstly if you want to use external data controlled outside hive use the external command when creating the table you can now insert data into this table this will create text files in s3 inside the directory location note depending on the data size and number of reducers there may be multiple text files
that would be a surprising reason to write a custom source and sink
there s a 45mn limit on bootstrapping tasks according to https forums aws amazon com thread jspa threadid 64568 the timeout for bootstrapping is 45 minutes and all the bootstrap actions put together should complete in that period
and if you delete this table the directory s3n logs july will remain as it is blank though because you had pointed it to a non existing location while table creation
this error occur because of multiple reason i have been playing around with hadoop
got this issue multiple times and cause was different if main nodes are not running check the logs if proper ip is not mentioned in host file after setting hostname provides its ip in hosts file so that other nodes can access it
seems like maven compiler plugin complaining that getdelegationtokensecretmanager method in hadoop fsnamesystem is not accessible due to method visibility i e
when the map function generate the intermediate result and first sent them to buffer the partitioning and sorting will start and if a combiner is specified it will be invoked at this time
so since they are set to the same thing that s wrong right there
but hadoop cmd should supersede hadoop home so that shouldn t be the root cause
as a result this one column will be split by sqoop as two different columns and hence the exception you are getting
but your data should be prepared accordingly
edit 2 in that case there s nothing much any tool can do as the delimiter character is coming in between the data field without any escape character or without enclosing strings like hello how are you
it is actually a class loading problem which is probably caused by using a stub version of some jar file
depending on your workflow it may be worth taking a look at oozie which can be a little awkward to get going on hdinsight but should help
note that this will lose anything you have in the hdfs which should be mainly intermediate results any output or input data held in the asv storage will persist in and azure storage account
i would do this by making sure i only submitted the job once for each file and rely on hadoop to handle the retry and reliability side so removing the need to manage any retries in your application
i ended up getting this fixed with a cheap hack the mapper wasn t sorting the results before the reducer started working
because i did this hadoop wasn t doing the sort bit in the middle
mapreduce sorts on key since you are sorting on nullwritable you are doing no sorting at all your map output keys should be your inputvalues
here i have a solution but i am not sure it is suit for you i suppose what you want to do is take away all the not required record which like a a b l1 a b c l2 a f g l2 not fit take away as there is no start from a to f through l2 so when take away some not required records we must know whether the records are required or not i give the solution as follow first we must have a in memory data structure db which like redis or hazelcast at the fist mapreduce we do nothing but insert data to the memory data structure db what we insert here is map data key is start level like a l1 b l5 and the value is a list which is the end so a map maybe like this a l1 b a l2 c g after the first mapreduce we will know all the required record because we have the inmemorydb and second mapreduce we take out the records that not fit for we can jude a record like a f g l2 at mapper we query the map in inmemorydb like getlist use the key a l1 use this because we here at l2 started form a is f in the list if f is in the it is required if not it is not
it s tempting to just add code in your reducer that as a side effect inserts data into your database
one reason to use a connector as opposed to just inserting data as a side effect of your reducer class is speculative execution hadoop can sometimes run two of the exact same reduce tasks in parallel which can lead to extraneous inserts and duplicate data
first parameter is your input source from hdfs location second parameter refers to mongodb uri that is going keep your results
for example based on the official documentation you need to copy the mysql jdbc driver into var lib sqoop2 directory on the node where you are running sqoop2 server
this means the results you are getting are correct
this other so question explains how to do this
finally this other so question gives more information on how the shuffle sort phase works in hadoop
this is important for client configuration as well so your local configuration file should include this element
in your case based on the error i can see dev144 192 168 137 1 8020
this is because the number of reducers you are using in the job is more than the number of key you actually have i e the words
so some of the output files from the reducers are having empty check the default partitioner how it paritions based on the number of reducers and the key based on which it sends data to reducers i e hashpartitioner link
ok big thanks to binary01 and davek3 for the direction
i ll have to do some reading to understand what s going on but for posterity s sake i ll share details here in an answer i got it to work by compiling the v2 0 code so it would take d mapred reduce tasks 1 which resulted in the correct output
you ll also need to deploy this configuration change to all 3 of your cluster nodes and finally you will need to restart the task trackers on all three nodes for the change to take effect
since you are running it from ide you should first change your pom to i suppose that anorak releases is local mvn repository and that you have hadoop core there
check if it is there since it wasn t working for me so i had to put instead to get it work
e g i m not sure what your udf is trying to do but convertdateformat sounds like a pretty straightforward method so if your code did not need to explicitly reference a pig class i d check it for bugs
if hive queries executing without a problem and summarized results are displayed in dashboards the problem could be with your hive query
all the nodes in hdinsight are based on the hortonworks data platform hdp for windows
1 the exception came because hive by default ignores the key of sequence file and hence when tries to match the schema gives the exception
this is probably the memory problem since collect set aggregates data in the memory
i had the same exact problem and came across this question so i thought i d share the solution i found
the first link explains how many mappers just an indication and reducers you should set for your mapreduce job so that you can achieve better load balancing
add partition supports an optional location parameter so you might be able to deal with this by saying again i ve not dealt with s3 but would be interested to hear if this works for you
i don t have articles but let s first look at it from 2 sides you need to have a reliable way to detect if the master really failed or the network is just partitioned there doesn t exist a 100 reliable way to do this you need to elect a new master this can be done with techniques you have described or to prevent network partitioning you can use the paxos algorithm to find a new master both points are complex on their own which i believe is the reason that they aren t covered in the mapreduce and gfs papers since those focus on something else
the cause is that your java dependancies are not complete you have lost the jar package hadoop auth 2 2 0 jar or its newer version
first make sure that the fields that you are summing up are of type int use describe a to check the data type after that i think since you have used filter condition and then used group by on f1 so while summing up you should use f1 instead of a use describe grpd1 and you will understand what i am trying to say there will be no a i guess this should solve the error
finally check the logic of what you want in the result i have not checked that
the kill node was not getting executed due to the mistake
by default all hadoop related jars would be added to hadoop classpath since hive internally uses hadoop command to execute
the latest information about running hadoop on the google cloud platform can be found here https developers google com hadoop there you can find hadoop setup scripts that allow you to quickly spin up a hadoop cluster based on configuration details that you specify
i ask because there is a problem in the cdh5 vm that hive can not access required third party libraries as you have discovered
if it is a simple linux command like pip or apt get then you should be able to install the packages like this i have never tried to install nltk specifically so i cannot help you there but you should be able to install along this line
given that amazon elastic map reduce uses ami based on amazon linux i verified that i can install nltk on amazon linux ami 2014 03 1 ami fb8e9292 64 bit using the following you might try incorporate those 3 lines into your mrjob conf
xmx1g and see the effect and if it succeeds then go smaller 2 set up mapred child ulimit to 1 5 or 2 times the size of max heap size as set previously
probable cause may be that data is not inserted well in hive table can you print the result of following command
https my vertica com docs 7 0 x html content authoring hadoopintegrationguide hdfsconnector loadingdatafromhdfs htm i don t see it in that doc in any case
the reason select from table works and select a from table doesn t is because when u do a select you need all the data which is lying there on hdfs hence it doesn t run s any m r job but in case of select a it has to run m r job to strip the extra columns
so effectively the issue is you are not able m r job on your cluster this issue is usually caused by insufficient space
please check the total capacity of your cluster and used remaining ratio using also check dfs datanode du reserved in the hdfs site xml if this value is larger than your remained capacity look for other possible causes explained here
depending on which version of hive you re using you may be able to do i think that was added in hive 0 11 or so
one of the other reasons to get this error is that running pig through local mode or hdfs mode
reason for error can be version compatability issue
because hbase depends on hadoop jars
turns out the node was explicitely listed in an exclusion list on the yarn resoure manager so there remove the names to be re used from etc hadoop conf yarn exclude call yarn rmadmin refreshnodes so yarn re reads this configuration file that did the trick in our case node managers booted up nicely and cleanly re registered
because on default hdfs namenode address is assumed to be hdfs localhost 8020 it needs to be changed
https github com spring projects spring xd wiki sources http to create a stream definition in the server using the xd shell post some data to the http server on the default port of 9000 this youtube video will walk you through an example http youtu be 41sihawjhe0 t 37m6s you have to post a few times depending on when your file will get full enough to roll over into a new chunk or you need to stop the stream to check the file
i put it here so it may help anyone facing the same issue in the future
the big hint came from using the libjars option with hadoop along with this line from the output the cause appears to be that giraphrunner uses its own configurationutils parseargs to get the org apache commons cli commandline instead of using the recommended org apache hadoop util genericoptionsparser getcommandline which honors the libjars option
for example on my machine which gives the expected output and results
maybe its because the sink being a logger logging everything depending on your mode
to resolve on your log4j properties replace the configuration accordingly flume root logger all logfile cheers
you just need to pass parameter before executing your pig script because right now you are passing parameter after your pig execute command
for example textinputformat computes the splits based on mapred max split size
it only does very simple maths based on this variable and the file size can be a bit more complex than that because of compression for example but you get the idea
because you read lines it is looking for n in the stream but you write characters which don t include n
first problem you will face with building the edw on top of hadoop is the fact that its storage is not updatable so you should forget about sql update and delete commands
because it is not that simple to do while when implemented it can be more scalable and more customizable than any proprietary solution
1 check the ssh directory permission try sudo chmod r 700 ssh on you directory may be it will help you if causing the issue
it depends on where do you have your hadoop libraries installed for instance if you re using the cloudera distribution you can use the following inside r
by using the java opts you can make sure the java heap of the reducer is not going to claim all memory since it also needs memory for os and core processes
ofc the best settings depend on your setup
if such is the case then you should choose the delimiter properly so that it appears exactly once
i copied all the jars in usr lib sqoop lib into user oozie share lib i copied all the jars in the usr lib oozie lib into user oozie share lib oozie after running the job again the workflow stalled and the error given was different from the last one namely that this time around the workflow was trying to create a directory on hdfs that already existed so i removed that directory and then ran the job again
this error is because of the delimiter symbol doesn t match the pigstorage in the csv file in the hdfs
this is causing because of precious cloudera scm agent service wasn t stopped correctly please try then restart the agent again
there are 2 differences between c3 8large and cc2 8xlarge that might cause issues c3 8xlarge machines have much less disk space 2 8 tb less
this means that less memory is allocated for each map an reduce task since both instance types have more or less the same memory the way you describe the problem it sounds like your job runs out of memory and therefore starts using the disk instead
we had concluded that the reason behind this is that m3 xlarge instances have a much smaller disk space than their m1 xlarge counterparts 1 6 tb less
hence we can write a query as per our need and use couchdoop to hit the view and fetch data
the deployment creates a user hadoop which owns hadoop specific ssh keys which were generated dynamically at deployment time this means since start all sh uses ssh under the hood you must do the following otherwise your normal username doesn t have ssh keys properly set up so you won t be able to launch the hadoop daemons as you saw
another thing to note is that the deployment should have already started all the hadoop daemons automatically so you shouldn t need to manually run start all sh unless you re rebooting the daemons after some manual configuration updates
i ll answer my own question to state that my query attempt was correct it was failing for other reasons that have nothing to do with syntax
this is actually equivalent to writing hive does not in fact support non equality joins so i set the join condition to true and filter my results on the where clause
thanks i believe the problems were around not having a bag to assign the foreach g results to so foreach g generate would not work but did
this caused the dependencies that has class names with the same class path to override each other like filesystem java for hadoop hdfs and hadoop common and the solution was just to build the jar without including dependencies
add following exclusion in the dependencies that caused conflict
for my specific case the resource directory is located in var lib ambari server resources i found that because in the error log listed above it shows that it s trying to look under the resources directory so i used the find cmd

datanode will not run because of several reasons
you will get the exact reason for failure 2 clear the datanode storage directory in your set up and restart all the services
now that i ve isolated the issue i m going to steadily increase the split size to find the right number
for random forests you should find the largest split possible to get the best results
unfortunately i don t know why the split size was causing the all datanodes are bad
i met the same problem when upgraded cassandra to 2 1 in our system and the root cause is as following
edit your timestampcomparator seems to have a typo you re setting ts2 to a when it should be set to b when it should be this would result in incorrectly sorted key value pairs and invalidates the assumption made by the grouping comparator that the key value pairs are sorted
based on this post i guess you are using cygwin and have some misconfigurations

before i copy the file i need to change to another directory i need the file to be in hence the cd storage before cat merged output gz
if your xml start tag is containing attributes like then you should use your start tag and end tag as do not close your first article tag so that it will take that tag as a tag with other attributes
depends on what you re trying to achieve
if you want your concatenated results to appear in the order of account id then you can expose accountid in the projection list
to fix this you should re use you should either initialize your variables and then just use the readfields methods this may have other knock on effects in your code as you re not currently using the object re use pattern which is more efficient than creating new objects for each k v object otherwise to keep your code as is but less efficient just update the readfields method as follows
the problem is that part size is a byte its maximum value is therefore indeed 127
one of the reason this might occur is your hbase site xml is not available in the classpath
update as you ve noted since setenvironmnet is static backend must be static as well
it belongs to the java class and thus any other object changing that variable e g
thanks to candiedorange who put me in the right path
it appears you may be running into a known issue that apparently impacts the append command most prominently if you happen to be running a default bdutil or click to deploy created hadoop cluster with 2 datanodes and if dfs replication is still at its default value of 3 hdfs 4600 hdfs file append failing in multinode cluster in a recent bdutil release 1 1 0 the default dfs replication is now 2 since default settings are already on persistent disk the replication of 2 is a tradeoff to allow hadoop to still have greater availability against single node failures while the underlying persistent disk provides durability
to access the fields but the dereference operator are mainly used to access the complex data types tuples bags and maps values when you use dereference operator to access the fields then pig will always expect the scalar output ie only one output after the filter condition unfortunately your filter condition age 27 return more than one matching result that is the reason you got scalar has more than one row in the output in case your filter condition age 27 return only one output then your stmt is perfectly valid
the advantage is that the developer doesn t have to worry about implementing their own groupings unlike the in map combiner and therefore memory issues are less likely
since your initial code is in python and it doesn t make much of a difference whether writing mr in python or java 3 should be the best option to pursue for your scenario
i think the reason is that basically threads cannot be forcefully killed in java
however since i cannot open all ports which need to run hadoop app turn off firewalld is reasonable such as and check the status
depending on whether the particulars of your use case can tolerate the additional runtime latency one possible approach is to define a view based upon your external table that dynamically recasts the columns at query time and direct queries against the view instead of the external table
i found 2 reasons for this error
in case someone faces same error then this answer might help them some jar files were missing from class path hence invocationtargetexception came
since we are using ant based build system and not maven based some jar files were missing
since we are using name node ha feature this file is a must
0 1 because it will return boolean value
the later will occupy a variable amount of space based on the value stored
pig uses jython and jruby libraries for compiling python and ruby udfs so it doesn t make any difference if we install additional module in the slave nodes separately
your user account doesn t have the correct permissions to the usr local hadoop directory so hadoop is failing when trying to create its logs
most things moved under usr hdp for hdp 2 2 so these are probably what you are looking for
both the lucene core and lucene codecs libraries provide org apache lucene codecs codec implementations so they both have a meta inf services org apache lucene codecs codec service file
it is because your map task is taking much time
job2 is dependent on job1
i mean depending on the blocksize and the average small file size maybe the gain is not so great
depending on your setup that might be too much
hence it fails due to execute permissions
first and foremost suppose you have the following collections with the test documents based on the example in your question to create the third collection lets call it output collection you would need to iterate over the trackings collection using the find cursor s foreach method convert the fields with the date strings to actual isodate objects create an array field that stores the survey result and then save the merged object into the third collection
high parallel loads will leak client connections leading to failure
now if it has to move the data it need rw permissions on the source folder hence the error
this is because a previous change has not been reflected in the metastore hence you need to run invalidate metadata from impala
assuming it is done the way the map reduce jobs are run by hive depends on many issues
give the scale at which you are running your program please calculated the memory requirements accordingly
which is comlpetelly ok since java installations are usually managed via alternatives subsystem
and again it s ok to have multiple different versions of java here thanks to alternatives subsystem
to check which java is installed run and then based on the results swich to one version of java and set java home accordingly
you are using blocking synchronous apis which won t work in the context of mvc web app due to using wrong async context by default
for safety reason you should use the same version of hbase for both compiling and running you jar
for safety reason you should use the same version of hbase for both compiling and running you jar
fixed so it does happen that there were multiple scala jars in the emr instances and they weren t coming from my application jar
based on a separate email thread with the question poster we traced the root problem to the fact that bdutil requires setting up gcloud compute ssh to work with no passphrase
check the connection because i don t have 10 reputation so i cannot post images to you
nullpointerexception is just because you don t have any directory in your hdfs
you will hit the same issue with the value bytes as well so i recommend you to do a defensive copy of this array too
about which files have been loaded in a partition if you had used an external table and just uploaded your raw data file in the hdfs directory mapped to location then you could a just run a hdfs dfs ls on that directory from command line or use the equivalent java api call b run a hive query such as select distinct input __ file __ name from but in your case you copy the data into a managed table so there is no way to retrieve the data lineage i e
which log file was used to create each managed datafile unless you add explicitly the original file name inside the log file of course either on special header record or at the beginning of each record which can be done with good old sed about how to automagically avoid duplication on insert there is a way but it would require quite a bit of re engineering and would cost you in terms of processing time extra map step plus mapjoin map your log file to an external table so that you can run an insert select query upload the original file name into your managed table using input __ file __ name pseudo column as source add a where not exists clause w correlated sub query so that if the source file name is already present in target then you load nothing more insert into table target select cola colb colc input __ file __ name as srcfilename from source src where not exists select distinct 1 from target trg where trg srcfilename src input __ file __ name note the silly distinct that is actually required to avoid blowing away the ram in your mappers it would be useless with a mature dbms like oracle but the hive optimizer is still rather crude
mostly the reasons could be because of wrong cassandra hostname port keyspace key conf etc
that happens because hortonworks by default disable json monitoring they use their own metric class to send the metrics to ambari metrics
create a swap table for your target table like below so that all the small files will be merged into a single file
hadoop doesn t use java serialization by default and you don t want to use it either because it s very ineffective you can check your io serializations property in configuration and you ll see list of used serializers including org apache hadoop io serializer writableserialization to fix this issue your toto class must implement writable
it turns out that the way the networking was configured i could communicate between these subnets but there was some type of a hidden gateway that caused the wrong ip address to be used
option 1 you tried you cannot copy from the machine hosting the vm to the vm unless you have defined a shared folder hence the home hduser downloads hadoop2 7 1 tar gz not found error
follow this generate public and private ssh keys ssh keygen copy the ssh public key id rsa pub to the root account on your target hosts ssh id rsa ssh id rsa pub add the ssh public key to the authorized keys file on your target hosts cat id rsa pub authorized keys depending on your version of ssh you may need to set permissions on the ssh directory to 700 and the authorized keys file in that directory to 600 on the target hosts
the command is not working because it is pointing to the newer version of hadoop jars avilable on the nodes instead of the hadoop jars of installed version it was pointing to jars placed in then i tried to execute it from the installation directory as below it worked for me
it looks like they are not because your attempt to do it should have load one file
collect and show are very different perhaps the performance difference you see is due to the difference between collect which pulls the entire resulting dataframe into the driver and show which by default only shows the first 20 rows of the resulting dataframe
it seems that you re not doing any shuffling operations in the lineage so it could be that the show is just pulling in only 20 rows instead of the whole dataset as in the collect case
running the hive command at present is somewhat broken due to the default metastore configuration
this thread is a bit old but when some one search google cloud platform and hive this result is coming
since you have implemented inner joins even if one table has missing records the entire result set is 0
try adding a left join with is null to validate that all the tables contribute to the result set
root cause com teradata connector common exception connectorexception internal fast load socket server time out internal fast load server socket time out when running export job using the internal fastload method the following error may occur internal fast load socket server time out this error occurs because the number of available map tasks currently is less than the number of map tasks specified in the command line by parameter of nummappers
this error can occur in the following conditions 1 there are some other map reduce jobs running concurrently in the hadoop cluster so there are not enough resources to allocate specified map tasks for the export job
just replace that line with the reason is that as you said the code you copy pasted from spark avro s wiki is for the version 2 0 1
in that specific case you will see a bunch of different ways to do the same as you did but the reason behind that is that spark api is also changing
remember that spark is moving really fast so you will see a lot of examples online that are all using different methods and you will often see that they are obsolete
according to the api it is deprecated since 1 4 0 use read load
you need to take care of the first value to get so there is a special case for that
recursive query is not supported because it introduces multiple stages with massive i o which is something that the underlying execution and storage engine not good at
hence the error you got
because reading the data from disk is a costlier operation than reading from memory
the only merit i have seen in this mechanism as per apache documentation please note that distributedcache has been deprecated since 2 6 0 release
since you are emitting only postcode and price from the map you can change your are code as below
you should not be dependent on vpn there can be other alternatives to have direct connectivity between the clusters
update end if you keep all configurations at one location each node will need to connect to that shared resource to load configuration every time it has to perform an action this would add to latency apart from consistency synchronization issues in case any config property is changed
it s not a good idea to store a large dataset on a single machine because if your storage system or hard disk crashes you may lose all of your data
now coming to your questions reason hadoop is a framework which allows distributed storage and computing
it has functionality of replication that means you are keeping multiple copy based on the replication factor of the same data
it works in your case because data is not shuffled or moved from executors to driver all is in one single jvm and local
collectaslist this method will collect all data from executors on driver node which causes shuffling and shuffling is a memory intensive process as it requires serialization network and disk io
javardd tolocaliterator produce the same results as collect but works on each partition sequentially and does not involve shuffling
in any case since your jobs are getting successfully finished you need not to worry and why it is getting successfully finished is because when trying to open a dataoutputstream to a datanode pipeline and some exception occurs then it keeps on trying until a pipeline is setup
the description of this parameter is so in your case this parameter has been set to so when you try to execute the hive query as user hdfs it tries to create following folder in your local file system and due to lack of permissions the operation fails gets translated into to solve this problem you need to give write permissions to all the users to the top level folder yarn nm
in the syslog file i found this gem 2015 12 23 08 31 42 376 info main org apache hadoop service abstractservice service jobhistoryeventhandler failed in state inited cause org apache hadoop yarn exceptions yarnruntimeexception org apache hadoop security accesscontrolexception permission denied user clott access execute inode tmp hadoop yarn staging history hadoop supergroup drwxrwx so the problem was permissions on hdfs tmp hadoop yarn staging history
you don t need to include the serde in your maven project since the jdbc api does not distribute the jar automatically for you like the hive shell does
it works for debugging but since there is only one jvm involved you are not doing parallell distributed computing in local mode
that is the reason nutch cannot connect to the cassandra store
customouputformat is also not a good idea since in any case you will have as many output files as the number of reducers
using a single reducer setnumreducetasks 1 could be a working solution but unnecessarily expensive since it kills parallelism all the data are processed by a single task
you cannot do it programmatically as its managed by hadoop and these files are created depends on the number of reducers configured
also recent versions of hive support parquet natively so you should be able to just say save as parquet instead of specifying serde inputformat outputformat
hadoop namenode single point of failure secondary namenode failure it s failure does not matter since primary namenode is available datanode failure if your replication factor is more than 1 datanode failure does not hurt as file blocks are available in other datanode
your mapper class needs to implement jobconfigurable configure in there you will read from the configuration object into local static variables now your map function needs to check this means any rows belonging to other buildings or outside the timestamp would not appear in the result
based on user feedback ibm is building an enhanced version of this service with an improved architecture
based on customer and trial user feedback we are building an enhanced version of this service
after making the change ambari prompts you to restart affected services so i took the option to do so
root cause the tar program i used on windows via tar zxf file tgz did not apply the proper attributes to the extracted files
the biggest problem i was running into was that sparkcontext newapihadooprdd method is very nice but returns a very strange rdd of the form rdd immutablebyteswritable result
i didn t need to do this in the original spark procedure for some reason
not sure if this is because of something spark was doing on its own in my qa cluster or perhaps i was never passing this rdd outside the procedure so it never had to be serialized
the setting total order partitioner path is wrong and totalorderparitioner is trying to use the default as a result
i will answer the question myself because i solved the issue and it too large for a simple comment
i changed configuration in core site xml from to since i was having problems with port 9000 i finally changed to port 8020 related issue
this is happening due to the missing jars in the classpath
pipe the result of cat command to the put command
you can achieve the same result via a mapreduce or spark job setting the parallelism for the output to 1 but there is not a solution using pure hdfs commands
so that one file instance is just the top of your testing problems here
thus you can t use on tablea col1 tableb col2 but you can only do on tablea col1 tableb col2
it seems like a previously inserted data causes this corruption
that type of error might be caused by not having writing permissions on the path you are executing the compilation
method 3 from sand box it will tell which port hbase master is running method 4 i think you can also check it from cloudera manager since you are using cdh5 5
so the result of the reducer would be something like in your case the reducer isn t doing anything
can you try changing to also i think you are using map side join and not reduce side since you are using the distributed cache in mapper
also sometimes behaviour with chararrays is unpredictable thus rule of thumb is to use long primitive type for timestamps
inquisitive mind i tried the full string including the offset but it not work the error is so i tried to use substring in this way substring grp foreach y generate timestamp substring timestamp 0 9 and then i stored it into a new file for manipulate it in freedom the output produced was two colum in the first it was the original timestamp in the second it was the new timestamp without the last three chars so i tried to launch this new script the output is so even if i knew that while deleting another char from the previus code i would try so i changed the range of the substring function timestamp 0 10
i cant see pom xml in that link
in addition to specifying the classpath of libraries you re depending on in order to compile your program you need to specify them when executing your program
as described by this cause some file s in your hdfs file system have become corrupted either by losing their last block replica or simply being underreplicated
note there is a big risk of this happening with temporary files or bogus sample data generated by teragen because frequently those file will have a replication factor set to 1 by default and if the datanode hosting that one replica goes down the file is irreparably corrupted eg
troubleshooting steps to get the full details of the files which are causing your problem you can run the following command the output of that command will identify the replication factor set on your corrupted files
there are different ways you can avoid this problem depending on your data blocks 1 the condition could just be transient if you have a data under replicated it should just automatically replicate the blocks to other data nodes to match the replication factor 2 if it is not replicating on your own run a balancer do not run the hdfs balancer if you use hbase
4 if it is just a temp file which is created while running the job when your speculative execution tasks are high make the speculative execution tasks nearly match the replication factor so that it wouldn t complain about the temp files after the job run
if so please comment so i can correct it
hence try avoiding distributed computing as a solution for your low data volume
and siss is a good option as it handles the data in memory so it would perform data aggregations data type conversions merging etc at a much faster rate than writing to the disk using temporary tables in stored procedures
depending on whether you loaded rdddata from gcs or hdfs the default split size is likely either 64mb or 128mb meaning your 200mb dataset only has 2 4 partitions
spark does this because typical basic data parallel tasks churn through data fast enough that 64mb 128mb means maybe tens of seconds of processing so there s no benefit in splitting into smaller chunks of parallelism since startup overhead would then dominate
in your case it sounds like the per mb processing time is much higher due to your joining against the other dataset and perhaps performing fairly heavyweight computation on each record
having different block sizes 64mb 128mb 256mb etc for the same file depending on the processing power of the datanode will not help as each hdfs block will be processed by one core
but it certainly doesn t make sense to split that one file in variable sizes of hdfs blocks based on the datanode
clocks speeds have almost reached a limit since quite some time almost a decade
besides there are some other reasons why hadoop designers would have decided against it specifying block size is allowed as a cluster wide setting as cricket 007 mentioned as well as overridable on a per file basis using dfs blocksize
this has direct impact on how data processing frameworks will handle those files which have variable blocksizes depending on the node
if the block sizes were dependent on datanode size compute power it would make it mandatory to have atleast as many number of nodes with similar computing power as the replication factor
these are possibly some reasons which introduce too many complexities and hence this feature is not supported
hence to overcome this i have implemented my own input format extending fileinputformat where i had the liberty to look further the new line chars r n for my endtag
since complete code is not there im not addressing your existing usecase though different use case which used int writable and float wriatble to calculate avg is just like below example
well since martin kleppmann provided a great answer to this question a few years ago i will just copy paste his message link to the avro mailing list archive if it works for avro it will work for you too
hence in a typical hadoop cluster both data nodes and node manager run on the same machine
you re replacing with but you re not splitting by comma so word still has type rdd string and not rdd array string as you seem to expect
then a a 5 treats each string as an array of chars thus the result you re seeing
in spark 2 0 now you have csv reader so you can simple load csv as follows you can select column by simply its name as follows
it s possible due to speculative execution
the slowness in long running task can be caused by network failures busy machine or faulty hardware
it depends on speed of that node if it is fast enough to process reduce task as compare to other nodes if yes then it is again feeded with another reduce task
while writing to the filesystem it tries to get the value of the object which is causing the nullpointerexeception
similarly any function call to the object will cause the same
depends on what type of values the array holds a client program need to decode its value by itself
you can loop though the result set and add the column values to arraylist in java
hadoop classpath must specify the folder where the jar file is located due to which it is unable to find the class definition
if you look at the javadoc for mapper link here you ll find the map method should look like map keyin key valuein value org apache hadoop mapreduce mapper context context where as yours looks like map text key iterable intwritable value context context so yours should be map longwritable key text value context context so because you aren t actually overriding the base map class in mapper your method isnt being called an its using the one in mapper which looks like this will be taking in longwritable and text and writting them back out identity mapper which doesnt match the text and intwritable you ve told it they should be
hence your map method should be defined as public void map longwritable key text value context context
it s the timeout exception in execute job in remotecommandexecuter java try increasing the maximum timeout to wait to get result
it waits for at most the given time for the computation to complete and then retrieves the result
you can combine both the steps into one and get results then you can load your sdf you can also refer to similar question how best to handle converting a large local data frame to a sparkr data frame
this is because the default volume choosing policy in the datanode is round robin
for instance to allow the jvm to use 1 gb 1024 mb of memory improve fix the application so that it uses less memory
you would expect that to cause oome
you could add the global tag on top of the workflow which acts as the global configuration for the actions in that workflow xml
i d test first to run this job even without repartitioning just remove this call and try to see if it succeeds without repartition call it will use default partitions split probably by size of input csv file i also hope that your input csv is not gzip ed since gzip ed data it s not splittable so all data will be in 1 partition
once you do you bring the rdd to the driver memory hence not using the abilities of spark
you cannot really compile it into your job s jar in a portable way since it s c and not java code
update note that the environment on your hadoop executors is set by your hadoop env sh so it needs to contain a line like java library path java library path etc opencv lib
since you are using spark 2 0 please verify the below spark session also try below and then print spark conf getall mkstring n you can see whether any difference in hive properties like hive metastore warehouse dir or hive metastore uris which were there in hive site xml with the above properties
as such you also need to adjust other important paths see hdfs default xml they are separate options because in real world environment it may be feasible to distribute temporary and non temporary data across different physical storage devices
use escaping on the path since it s windows and uses backslashes hadoop fs copyfromlocal c users desktop terrorism csv user mydata terrorism csv always a little nifty with the path escaping on windows but this way it works
as it can be read therefore a file compressed in hdfs using snappy codec can be read using hadoop fs text but not in a hadoop streaming job mapreduce
in retrospect it makes sense on a command line it s the shell that would parse the list of arguments into an args array for the java executable but oozie is not a shell interpreter and experience shows that beeline accepts two syntax variants for its command line args xvalue one arg means option x with associated value x followed by value two args means the same thing so you have two correct ways to pass command line arguments to beeline via oozie argument xvalue argument argument x argument argument value argument on the other hand argument x value argument would fail because in single arg syntax beeline considers that the separator space should be part of the value
when static group mapping is defined then all further group lookup mechanisms inside hadoop are bypassed so you won t see this error anymore
your program behave as expected in local mode because mapper reducer and job are launched on same jvm
you might want to set the environment variable for shell action also seems like you are importing multiple tables so you may want to create a sub directory under the target directory for each table
that s because when you do hadoop fs ls without specifying any path the default path which is considered is user username and the directories files inside user username are listed
both of them should give you the same results
hence use ddl as below use back tick
this is error because this is very good blog post for distcp
and this is desirable behavior because you don t want instances talking to other instances or to themselves
using their public addresses since you pay a transport charge for data that hairpins out and back on through the internet gateway
from docs https hbase apache org apidocs org apache hadoop hbase mapreduce multitableinputformat html your case use scan scan attributes table name since you are not setting table at scan instance level you are getting this npe please follow this example where you have to set the table name inside your for loop not outside then it should work
it is not directly related to the hadoop version but it is based on the spark version you run
hive hivevar buckets should be high enough relatively to the number of reducers mapred reduce tasks so the rows will be evenly distributed between the reduces
and as you said you don t need it to be sequential so this should ideally suffice your requirement
you must be given input folder as an input path in which you must have two files with same content and that might be reason for double count
get the pid of the process using the port also verify which process is using the port and kill the process now that the port is free try restarting the cluster
if the process cannot be killed change the port of datanode by adding this property to hdfs site xml refer hadoop bindexception for all possible causes of this error
this space might be freed after you run the job so you may need to check it while the job is running
only one process can connect to the metastore database at a time so it is not really a practical solution but works well for unit tests
so the issue was insert overwrite was trying to create too many small files
there are no actual error in that screenshot that information is informational only
hadoop will just ignore those properties since they aren t used anymore
you posted at least a portion of your hive site xml it doesn t look complete but these also may not be in that xml anyway
the are info messages about the sjf bindings being duplicated in the classpath are likely due to having a duplicate jar file somewhere
essentially what happens is you now have two jar files with different name yet both have identical classpaths inside them causing these types of messages about classpath having duplicates in it
in that classpath message it also shows you the duplicate jar files both with the name of this info line sjf
when you did this whatever version s you updated to no longer uses some of the properties the original version used for some reason which is why it is telling you they are deprecated or no longer used
high level overview is something like example your input files server1 log server2 log server3 log inputformat will create number of split based on block size by default corresponding to each split a mapper will allocated to work on each split
setup called once at task start and cleanup called once at the end so you can make your connection to database in setup method probably not just connect but load all cities in memory for performance and close connection if you decided not to load data but just connect in cleanup
you can t insert the data like this or insert command because insert command use in sql
thus resulting to ambiguous situation
the real cause of the problem is each of this component requires a different version of guava which has very fast paced commits and compatibility between versions is not ensured
here is quick look at version dependency spark v1 6 1 guava v14 0 1 hbase v1 2 4 guava v12 0 janusgraph 0 1 1 guava v18 0 even if you make all three jars available in classpath you will keep getting guava specific due to the conflicting versions
this happens because com google guava guava 18 0 artifact might not be present in the classpath or there might be multiple versions of the same jar present on the classpath
output looked something similar to this as opposed to this you can see that the last value of mumbai has a temperature of 56 which is the highest temperature for kolkata i noticed that this was because of not resetting the temp and the max temperature for each call of the reduce function
since there are no errors in your flume log make sure all sinks sources and channels are initialized
sometimes you can miss that messages in the log and in that case no exceptions or errors are reported
also you re piping your data files to your script so that they will be available as sys stdin in the script but your code to discover which of them is currently being read is completely wrong
when you run hadoop streaming os environ map input file will be set by hadoop framework so that you can get the filename
hdfs will not throw error because 1280 mb of storage limit is not exhausted
thus you can store roughly max
thus even if you have much more storage capacity you will not be able to utilize it fully if you have multiple small files reaching the memory limit of namenode
thus there should not be any error
since you re saying this is fairly persistent in the last few days i wonder if something about your input data has changed and if you were running close to 100 utilization before the failures started
since compute engine vms don t configure a swap partition when you run out of ram all daemons will crash and restart
thanks to javierluraschi from sparklyr
if you re bale to get the result you may use the command assign them to bash variables
it s because of the same hostname ekbana
unfortunately oozie spark action supports only java artifacts so you have to specify the main class that error message hardly trying to explain
change arraylist string to arraylist text because hive requires serializable types such as floatwritable intwritable or text
so that leaves the question of using the multi part api to perform conditional atomic commits
the gcs connector for hadoop does currently use something called resumable uploads where it s theoretically possible for a node to be responsible for committing an object that has been uploaded by a completely different node the client libraries just aren t currently structured to make this very straightforward
however at the same time the copy and delete phase of a gcs rename is also different from s3 in that it is done as metadata operations instead of a true data copy
otherwise real solutions really do involve writing fewer bigger files since even if you fix the write side you ll suffer on the read side if you have too many small files
gcs is heavily optimized for throughput so anything less than around 64mb or 128mb may be spending more time just on overhead of spinning up a task and opening the stream vs actual computation should be able to read that much data in maybe 200ms 500ms or so
in that vein you d want to make sure you set things like hive merge mapfiles hive merge mapredfiles or hive merge tezfiles if you re using those or repartition your spark dataframes before saving to gcs merging into larger partitions is usually well worth it for keeping your files manageable and profiting from ongoing faster reads
edit one thing i forgot to mention is that i ve been loosely using the term repartition but in this case since we re strictly trying to bunch up the files into larger files you may do better with coalesce instead there s more discussion in another stackoverflow question about repartition vs coalese
this is based on ryan s s3committer at netflix and is the one which is going to be safest to play with at first
magic committer called because it does magic inside the filesystem
because it is listing files in s3 it will need s3guard to deliver consistency on aws s3 other s3 implementations are consistent out the box so don t need it
in tests the staging committer is faster than the magic one for small test scale files because the magic committer talks more to s3 which is slow though s3guard speeds listing getfilestatus calls up
both are faster than using rename due to how it is mimicked by list copy gcs and hadoop spark commit algorithms i haven t looked at the gcs code here so reserve the right to be wrong
tread dennis huo s statements as authoritative if gcs does rename more efficiently than the s3a copy then delete it should be faster more o file than o data depending on parallelisation in the code
the changes in the mapreduce code under fileoutputformat are designed to support different pluggable committers for different filesystems so they have the opportunity to do something here
i solved this issue as there is issue in making fat jar and the in new hbase version jars are deprecated with many dependency so i also added hbase client 1 2 6 jar and hbase common 1 2 6 jar to eclipse externally and then building fat jar this solved my issue
stay with the filesystem apis because of it s low level nature it s actually where most of the s3 performance dev goes
i have shown my scenario drop statement however these steps will surely help across all sorts of queries which leads to the read timeout exception
it won t work by default since the file is not marked as executable
first i tried it in the shell and then in oozie because i launched a sh file that contains the spark submit sencence
beeing enclosed the character like the one in salary field will should be automatically escaped and therefore saved as part of the corresponding column value
you are trying into c spark but pyspark file present into this location c spark bin pyspark so you need to go on this location and try to run pyspark
there can be many reasons why we are getting this error
no internet didn t help since i am still a noob in scala hive i can t provide a good explanation
there are not listed because there are not spark properties
thus a compressed parquet will look from the outside the same as a compressed one normally they don t include any suffix like normal compressed files have e g
the datanodes got too out of sync to accept any more files because they were too slow
the datanodes were too slow because they were using du to check filesystem usage and i had a lot of small files spark checkpoints
since my volumes were on a separate volume anyway i changed it to using df by specifying the variable fs getspaceused classname in the core config as org apache hadoop fs dfcachinggetspaceused
this doesn t make sense in that loop
in that case you need to override the recordreader with an implementation where 5 lines are one record and passed together to the mapper
the inputformat is responsible for defining how the block is split into individual records
as you identified there are many inputformats and each is responsible for implementing code that manages how it splits the data into records
realistically your company sounds like their cluster is not using kerberos so it isn t even secure
each task counters either for mapper or reducer are related to task attempt so when task attempt fails due to a bug io problems or killed speculative execution related counters are dropped
and registered the jar with hive to create my udf assuming i already have a simple table sample when i create a view as follows and then on successive select on the view i get different results
keep in mind that the udf can t be passed parameters using hiveconf xxx since this will be evaluated and baked into the view definition
the reason is same as why the first approach doesn t work
please check the interpreter log more the error you see is due to fail to create sparkcontext you need to check log to see why sparkcontext is failed to create
it provides a good understanding of yarn and mr memory setting how they relate and how to set some baseline settings based on the cluster node size disk memory and cores
these files may be defined per service or once for the entire stack so you may take a look at role command order json files in your stack
in my case i was receiving this error keepererrorcode nonode for hbase master because hmaster process was not running
if you don t see hmaster process as in above list then that s the reason for error keepererrorcode nonode
in my case there were 2 reasons first which i solved by replacing localhost with my machine s hostname in hbase site xml
from this answer second this was because the hdfs port in hbase site xml was different than that in core site xml of hadoop
i know it is not related with spark but i was getting following errors caused by java io ioexception org apache zookeeper keeperexception nonodeexception keepererrorcode nonode for hbase meta region server caused by org apache zookeeper keeperexception nonodeexception keepererrorcode nonode for hbase meta region server caused by org apache zookeeper keeperexception nonodeexception keepererrorcode nonode for hbase hbasei setting hbase rootdir configuration resolved my problems while creating hbasecontext so you may try add that config into hbase site xml
edit the start container sh in this way edit the lines 10 16 responsible for starting the hadoop master container to this sudo docker run itd v home ke mnt ke net hadoop p 50070 50070 p 8088 8088 name hadoop master hostname hadoop master kiwenlau hadoop 1 0 dev null the main difference to note here is the v switch which mounts the home ke volume from your host system to the docker container in mnt ke
date data type format in hive only accepts yyyy mm dd as your date field is not in the same format and that results null values in creation month field value
i was facing this issue because i changed my project s build from sbt to pom
the reason this is required is that oozie will run on any random yarn node and pretend that you had a hundred node cluster and you would otherwise have to ensure that every single server had user oozie my code sh file available which of course is hard to track
your mappers have started to read files in partition location and at the same time you dropped partition this caused drop files because your table is managed
this causes runtime filedeletedinmetadatanotfoundexception exception
if you still want to drop partition during reading it try this if you make your table external then drop partition should not drop the files they will remain and it should not cause exception and you can remove partition location from filesystem later
unfortunately already started job cannot detect that hive partition with files was dropped and gracefully skip reading them because hive metadata has already been read query plan built and splits can be already calculated
finally i found the root cause
and when it is running hive command it will auto append the properties in that file
afaik cdh5 14 x is based on the old hadoop version 2 6 0 which does not have resourceestimator tool
according to the bash manual process substitution cmd s gets treated as a file so you can interpret this as your options are install a later version of bash rewrite the 2 instances of in hadoop functions sh which are the only instances you d hit of this construct
you re asking several questions so lets take them one at a time
what is the best practice to copy it over all other worker nodes so that when pyspark runs in those workers i don t get the import error
it sounds like your data is already decently sharded this is a good reason to just read it from gcs directly in spark
quick startup in hdfs a mapreduce job can t start until the namenode is out of safe mode a process that can take from a few seconds to many minutes depending on the size and state of your data
with cloud storage you can start your job as soon as the task nodes start leading to significant cost savings over time
in distributed mode in a hadoop cluster the plugins are contained in the job file runtime deploy apache nutch 1 x job start with the source package or the nutch source code cloned from git adapt the configuration in conf note also configuration files are shipped in the job file build nutch ant runtime run runtime deploy bin nutch or runtime deploy bin crawl hadoop jar jobfile is called to launch the nutch jobs so the executable hadoop must be on path
i ve found a way to provision all nodes with needed files using emr bootstrap actions so i created a script to copy nutch plugins from s3 bucket to tmp nutch plugins directory then uploaded this script to s3 bucket and added custom bootstrap action while configuring the cluster
normally this problem is either due to bad dns configuration firewalls or network unreachability
adding or modifying a partition column s comment need to be done in the metadata database due to the nature of design of hive partitions
the simplest way to access hdfs through hadoop cli is to ssh on the dataproc cluster master node and use cli utilities there it doesn t work in cloud shell because it doesn t have hadoop cli utilities pre installed
there is no need to upload anything because mapr feels and acts just like an ordinary file system
that is those commands and the shell do quoting correctly and you can get the result you want relatively trivially
in that case you must set the property fs s3a endpoint either in core site xml or in the job configuration
here are two methods or that said i thought hive supported aliases in group by so this should also work this would not work if item no were a column in the table though
use split function result or use lastname pattern for split it will allow something else with except starting with lastname
for both queries with or without last name its working in this way using split for hive no need for any table to select you can directly execute the function like select functionname result you can make a single query
spark kafka is claimed to have exactly once processing semantics so i would suggest you focus on error capturing and monitoring over just count validation
note that there is a startup cost of this so you likely want to annotated your tests with dirtiescontext classmode dirtiescontext classmode after each test method in order to prevent cluster restart for each test
you have to point environment variable hadoop home to it and depending on version load its shared library
i do not have experience with spark so i do not know how it glues with hadoop
when writing data for each partition spark write a single file so you can check to see that it is truly 300 parquet files where you write your repartitioned dataframe
is there some reason you don t want to initialize rt like this
because the variable is static it will be initialized once when class is loaded in memory
the first issue typically tends to cause very quick out of memory issue so it s unlikely that
if you re running in 2 9 0 issues because it s the trunk and may not be stable you can also backport the two patches by downloading and compiling locally xmleventeventreader and markupparser then package output as a 00patch jar so that it comes before the scala libs jar and drop it under scala home lib of your 2 8 1 install
i haven t used hadoop in this method before so this is just me finding a similar thing and noticing differences
and you don t have one and thus it can t be found
here it is http svn apache org viewvc hadoop hdfs trunk src test hdfs org apache hadoop hdfs minidfscluster java revision 1127823 view markup pathrev 1130381 i think there are plenty of uses of it in that same directory but here is one http svn apache org viewvc hadoop hdfs trunk src test hdfs org apache hadoop hdfs testwriteread java revision 1130381 view markup pathrev 1130381
since the number of nodes is 2 here you cannot set the number of reducers to be greater than 2
i also met this problem through the check soucecode found that because of sample increase the reduce number makes in the splitpoint have the same element so throw this error
what you want to do is add file filename so that filename can be added to distributed cache
what hive basicly does is convert your queries to hadoop map reduce jobs so they are executed on the machines that have task trackers
jobinprogress is defined as below so it should not be used
interfaceaudience limitedprivate mapreduce interfacestability unstable not that jobcounter total launched maps also includes map tasks launched due to speculative execution also
because hadoop use java home jre bin java to spawn task program instead of java home bin java
i got the solution hence i am replying my own answer you must have following two lines in hadoop env sh in conf directory of hadoop save it and restart mapred by stop mapred sh and start mapred sh now run in bin directory of hadoop now you can verify the dump by hitting finally you need to copy the whole thing into your local file system for which run here are the references that helped me out in export import and in hadoop shell commands hope this one helps you out
just be very careful if your are running this is a cluster of servers because each server will write the result files in their own local file systems
it is based on the hive jdbc driver but it includes a wrapper around it to avoid some problems
format happens because the versioninfo class in hadoop common jar attempts to locate the version info using the current thread s class loader
it said the problem is because the file hadoop eclipse plugin 0 20 203 0 jar lost 5 files commons configuration 1 6 jar commons httpclient 3 0 1 jar commons lang 2 4 jar jackson core asl 1 0 1 jar 和 jackson mapper asl 1 0 1 jar
this is likely because you have not rebuilt yet
so long as your jar doesn t include an hbase site xml this approach should result in the jvm loading the hbase site xml from your classpath
for the same reason that the following fails getbytes returns the backing byte array but according to the api the bytes are only valid upto text getlength text getbytes yes this does have to do with encoding the charsetencoder encode method uses a bytebuffer whose size is initially allocated to 12 1 1 bytes 13 in length but the actual valid number of bytes is still only 12 as you are using solely ascii characters
your jps output shows that you do not have a jobtracker nor tasktracker running hence the connection issue when trying to communicate with the jobtracker
export hadoop opts server export hadoop opts djava security krb5 realm ox ac uk djava security krb5 kdc kdc0 ox ac uk kdc1 ox ac uk when you add these two variables you will not see any error or warning during starting daemons so that you can resolve your issue
if you want to use python3 you can use and do not use because it would fail on most computers including mine sigh check this answer for more info
run it with count sh so the shebang line will take effect or just say bash count sh
you don t actually need any reducers though so the number of reducers would be set to zero
src examples org apache hadoop examples that comes with the distribution so you can do this in your main class in your searchmapper class you can do this
if you have 1000 files is there any reason to use a finely grained parallelized technique
also it looks like you are grepping a literal string not a regex you can use the f grep flag to search for string literals which may speed things up depending on how grep is implemented optimized
i haven t worked with mapreduce specifically so this post may or may not be on point
gridgain data grid will automatically partition your data set across the cluster based on keys so as long as you have your similar text pieces properly implement standard java hashcode and equals you should be fine
your textkey should implement a lsh hashcode so that similar text values are likely to go to the same partition
if the keys are strings text objects the default sorter will work but i think this is not going to affect your result given the scenario you described
i think mapreducepolicyprovider java use import org apache hadoop security authorize refreshauthorizationpolicyprotocol mradmin java use import org apache hadoop mr1security authorize refreshauthorizationpolicyprotocol this mismatching causes of error
you keep going until the distance to the buckets and therefore all the points in them is greater than your minimum range
this should only be used on jobs that are failing because the storage is never reclaimed
in that catch block you can also write additional information to a file including the stack trace the key and value or utterable passed in etc
pig which uses the hadoop integration is actually perfect for this type of work because you can not only read but also write data back into cassandra using cassandrastorage
since nosql files are unidirectional this could be a very time consuming operation in cassandra itself
thus you can calculate the max min avg based on the points of a curve in the reducer and output curve max min avg as the final result
generally speaking you model the data in hbase based on you read and write access patterns
a reason to divide data into two column families is if there are a lot of cases where you need data from one and not the other
thus the data is read from hdfs and not from your local hard disk
i think it s likely that this is your problem it s very possible that the whitespace is causing you problems
in case of dump pig stores the output at a temporary location e g hdfs localhost tmp temp797130848 tmp1101984728 have a look pig map output dirs in your job s config xml pigrunner run calls gruntparser processdump string alias at some point of the process which iterates through the result tuples and prints them out to the console after this but before returning it also calls filelocalizer deletetempfiles which deletes this temporary directory
now you want to return the result of alias b outputstats s iterator tries to open the temporary file again to loop over the tuples as pigrunner run did it before
but the problem is that this file doesn t exist anymore therefore your get the exception
so i d suggest you to remove the code after system out println stats stats getreturncode since you already have the dump printed out
here is what kmeansdriver is trying to do as you can see it has converged after 3 iterations and is trying to merge the result of the 3rd iteration in directory clusters 3 into clusters 3 final to show it is finished
removing this directory should fix your issue you can do it via command line with or since it looks like you re running your job in local mode to avoid this kind of issues i would recommend using a unique output directory everytime you run your analysis you could for example take the current date and append it to the filename of your output path for example using system currenttimemillis
edit for your second issue about you are actually suffering from a conflict between mahout versions because older mahout versions used weightedvectorwritable while more recent ones use weightedpropertyvectorwritable
looks like you have broken repository references that are unrelated to cloudera but causing your install to fail
set the system path variable to the location of chmod exe if you have installed cygwin64 using windows installer then your chmod exe should exist under for me i have installed cygwin in my c drive so the value of my system path variable is c cygwin64 bin
how you set this is indeed a little complex because there are several properties and they changed in hadoop 2
but the right answer really depends on your version and your data
you need to change your memory settings for hadoop as the memory allocated for hadoop is not enough to accommodate the job requirement you are running try to increase the heap memory and verify due to over uses of memory os might be killing the processes due to which job is failing
there s no reason to restrict yourself to bytes that represent a string
keep in mind that the side effect is that you may not be able to read the content of the table without the appropriate de serialization code
this is a known issue of hadoop since versions above 0 22 0 although i m uncertain whether it has been fixed in the most recent versions
you are adding add1 twice therefore in the write loop you get only 1 element out of the set instead of two
the set allows you to inadvertently add extra values to the set and your write method will write out 0 1 2 or more depending on the set size your readfields method explicitly expects 2 in the for loop
so i think becuase you are looping in the readfields method that may be the reason behind your problem
another reason is using google collections and guava in the same time
as a result i see the following stacktrace exclude google collection from dependency tree to avoid conflicts to see the class loading use xx traceclassloading jvm option
this is a late response but i actually ran into the same problem so i thought i would put my solution to avoid this situation http xkcd com 979 in my case it was dut to the fact that i had a wrong dependency in my pom
to connect to cdh use the dependencies listed there http www cloudera com content cloudera content cloudera docs cdh4 4 2 0 cdh4 installation guide cdh4ig topic 31 html or whichever version of cloudera you are using so the dependencies of your client should look like and not also pay attention to the kind of hadoop running yarn or mr1
your reducer class is defined as so the reducer should have input text intwritable and output text intwritable but you have defined your reducer as which expects input text iterable text which does not match what your reduce class is extending
when a particular reducer has received all the slices it needs it merges them all together and sorts the result by the k2 key and then groups records on the fly by that key for individual calls to reduce
the load of doing all that data movement is spread across the whole cluster because each reducer task knows what outputs it wants and asks for them from each mapper
while the jobsubmission is happening fileinputformat decides how to divide the files into splits split 1 or more hdfs blocks depending on your splitsize
probably because your map reduce code cannot deal with composites
most probable causes incorrect path of the jar
this error was caused by permission issue for me
explanation the query presented by the original question produces errors because of the select from clause
one would notice that the following query will still actually work even before adding the json serde jar file this query works because hive does not need to extract elements from a particular column within a row and thus does not need to know what the format of a row is
i faced the same issue today so i used the following properties
i finally tried to run the ruby scripts themselves at the console and this gave the result this seemed odd as the exe existed in the directory shown
this scales weka s pca analysis in the number of instances but not in the number of original features since the pca computation still happens locally on the client machine
depending on the algorithm it may be quite complex to rewrite it to use hadoop
the hadoop implementation of s3 file system is out of date so writing data to s3 from hive doesn t work well
here the criterion for comparing two nodes is the sum of the sizes of all sets in the node which matches the example that was given although it intuitively does not make sense because it does not correspond to any real subset relationship
the ordering with the output is a bit difficult because the result isn t fully ordered
xml uses a fairly standardized structure so i would be interested in seeing your data format and what delimiter isn t working
example code results rss txt data file
you can put in nested entities by using hbase s flexibility because of the way columns are designed
hadoop helps to do processing on big data so this is the connection between hadoop and ml
see apache mahout works specifically for clustering classification and currently based on hadoop
if you had a previous instance of the result saved then the subsequent wait azurehdinsightjob and get azurehdinsightjoboutput would be referring to a previous run giving the illusion of the same error for the not found case
the reason for that problem is probably the input data file is very small but in the code you set the maxsplitssampled to 10 in randomsampler text text double freq int numsamples int maxsplitssampled you can solve the problem by set that parameter to 1 or just make sure it is not larger than the splits number of you input file
however i found what s caused the issue for me and so i post this hoping that it will help anyone else whose google search led them to this truly ancient hadoop thread
i should have used local mode because i did not have access to a hadoop cluster
try accounting for any nulls in the relation
reseting to the beginning in a mapreduce framework would be acceptable since you would still get to read the file from the beginning getting better overall speed
reseting the iterator to a random point would be counter to the mapreduce mind set because it would likely require random access from a file
there is a ticket in hadoop s jira explaining why they chose not to make the iterator cloneable although it does indicate that it is possible that it would be since the values would not have to be stored in memory
neo4j is a graph database reliable and fast for managing and querying highly connected data http www neo4j org 1 decide structure of nodes relationships and there properties and accordingly you need to create api that will get data from facebook and store it in neo4j
so in fact you need following components a relational database since you want to request data in a structured quick way from experiences i would pressure the fact to have a fully normalized data model in your case with tables users groups users2groups also have 4 byte surrogate keys over larger keys from facebook for back referencing you can store their keys as attributes but internal relations are more efficient on surrogate keys establish indexes based on hashes rather than strings eg
crc32 lower string an example select would than be this select somethinguseful from users where name searchstring and hash crc32 lower searchstring never ever establish unique columns based on strings with length 8 byte unique bulk inserts can be done based on hashes string checking via insert select once you got that settled you could also look into sparse matrices see wikipedia and bitmaps to get your users2groups optimized however i have learned that this is an extra that should not hinder you to come up with a first version soon a cron job that is run periodically ideally along the caps facebook is giving you so if they rule you to not request more often than once per second stick to that not more but also try to come as close as possible to the cap invest some time in getting the management of this settled if different types of requests need to be fired request for user records requests for group records but maybe hit by the same cap most of the optimization can only be done with development so if i were you i would stick to any high level programming language that does not bother to much with var type juggling and that also comes along with a broad support for associative arrays such as php and i would programm that thing myself i made good experiences with setting up the cron job as web page with deactivated output buffering for php look at ob end flush void easy to test and the cron job can be triggered via curl if you channel status outputs via an own function eg with time stamps this could then also become flexible to either run viw browser or via command line which means efficient testing efficient production running your user ui which only requests your database and never ever never the external system api lots of memory to keep your performance high optimal all your data index data fits into database memory cache dedicated to the database if you use mysql as database you should look into innodb flush log at trx commit 0 and innodb buffer pool size just google if interested hadoop is a file system layer it could help you with availability
so increasing your ram to be able to load the full database can gain you performance improvements by a factor of 2 1000 depending on from where you are coming from
further much further down the line you would find this neo4j not enough ram dedicated to the database to load all data mysql not enough ram dedicated to the database to load all data in worst case mysql will even put indexes to disk at least partly which can result in massive read delay
thus it will need to set permissions write some files or create directories
in case it doesn t find the binary it will fallback to the java implementations anyway so you don t need to worry
however there is no built in configuration to turn this message off so the only way to really fixing it is to recompile your hadoop common jar without this error i guess installing winutils isn t that bad compared to it
the cause of the problem is the use of file api for reading hdfs files
the answer thus far disable firewall or allow high ranges 32768 65535 to on each data node
while querying the table since we already know the range calculator we can select employeename employeeid from table2 where employeeid range 2 thus we can also parallelise the queries of given ranges
checked executor logs stderr in tmp mesos slaves and found out that java home was not set so the hadoop dfs command was not able to run to fetch the executor
i checked the spelling of every word and even the file encoding since hdfs xml claiming to use utf 8 but actually use ansi i finally found
it s just because i forgot to put a set of around in yarn site xml
i suggest people with this problem rename each xml file of a time to disable the custom settings for testing which file caused the problem
by the way i also found i misplaced some setting on log aggregation in mapred site xml instead of in yarn site xml but it didn t cause any warning or error message at all
the code in falsetru s answer can deadlock because it creates two pipes stdout pipe stderr pipe but it reads only from one pipe proc stderr
the deadlock happens because the parent tries to read from the stderr pipe that is empty because the child is busy trying to flush its stdout
thus both processes hang
when i got this error it was due to crlf line endings instead of lf
the hadoop el functions are only available for oozie mapreduce actions so you won t be able to use them for your java action even though it presumably ran a mapreduce job
for the time being the gcs connector for hadoop doesn t support fine grained hdfs permissions and thus the reported 700 is fake in fact permissions are controlled via acls and if using the service account with read write access any linux user in the authenticated gce vm is in fact able to read write execute on all files inside gcs
important that said note that the click to deploy solution doesn t currently officially support pig or hive in part because it doesn t yet set up the more advanced nfs consistency cache introduced in gcs connector 1 3 0 bdutil 0 36 4 with automated setup of the list consistency cache
without the list consistency cache hive and pig may unexpectedly lose data since they rely on ls to commit temporary files
alternatively if you don t care about the version too much the default hive 0 12 0 receives continuous testing and validation from google s engineering teams so you ll have a better validated experience
in the end i figures it out and it was of course obvious here s how i have done it add a bootstrap action that downloads the jars on every node for example you can upload the jars in your bucket make them public and then do wget https yourbucket path somejar jar o home somejar jar wget https yourbucket path avro 1 7 7 jar o home avro 1 7 7 jar wget https yourbucket path avro mapred 1 7 7 jar o home avro mapred 1 7 7 jar when you specify libjars in the optional arguments use the abosolute path so libjars home hadoop somejar jar home avro 1 7 7 jar home hadoop avro mapred 1 7 7 jar i have lost a number of hours that i am ashamed to say hope this helps somebody else
this was because the value for the column in question was missing and i assumed the 1 byte indicated null value
cf fam col somecolumn type int changing type to string resolved the problem and missing values displayed as null instead of result in an error
root cause for me is that the data produced consumed is not through the same api
because on hbase the type is string but the entity in my class is integer so bytes can t transform
i m going to take a pretty good guess it s because you re using app
that means in this case the entire justspark class since one of its members is referenced
therefore spark is unable to send it over the wire
in particular you have a reference to sparkcontext which does not extend serializable so your first code which does broadcast only the variable value is the correct way
having the code in the body of the object seems to cause problems
since your cell has strings of format ddd dd
simple only 2 reasons to get this type of problem 1 wrong path 2 no privileges permissions to that jar ok not only that include other system paths
can t comment questions yet unfortunately so putting suggestions here please post command outputs rpm qa grep ambari server cat etc release also it will be good to know which postgres version is avaliable rpm qa grep postgres i guess it has something to do with python version but only guess for now
to really know which file and location for sure simply edit the python script usr lib64 python2 6 fileinput py add a line above the code to print the files it s looking for note i hit a similar situation and it was pointing to var lib pgsql data which did not exist real location was under data pghadoop so what i did was create a symbolic link to my real location i e
the first root cause is the startup script postgresql assumes the default data path is at var lib pgsql92 data however we can see nothing under var lib pgsql92 data instead of we should see thing under var lib pgsql9 here is workaround fix the default data path for ambari bundled postgresql sudo ln s var lib pgsql9 var lib pgsql edit postgresql script sudo vim etc init d postgresql comment it pgsuffix 92 change below pgdata var lib pgsql pgsuffix data pglog var lib pgsql pgsuffix pgstartup log to pgdata var lib pgsql data pglog var lib pgsql pgstartup log
i have set the value to 20 but you may want to reduce this even further depending on your dataset and the amount of ram available
i solved this problem by creating a new database of same name i e first db immediately after that old tables were not displayed by using show tables command so i restarted my hive hadoop and ubuntu machine
the second one sets the owner of that directory to the current user you so that flume ng running as your user can write to it
you are getting this error probably because you are running command directly on console you ve to first go to the bin in flume and try running your command there over console
so spark doesn t ship with the hadoop site or yarn site files since those are specific to your hadoop installation
if you can t find either of those your hdfs command has presumably found your config so you could always run strace on it and look for where its loading the configuration file from
there are a large number of reasons why this could happen and the exact specific details will likely be in the logs on the executor worker machines
the reason for this error in the first place is that you might be having too many services running on your cluster
however since you are interested in pickling a subclass of an extension type you can actually do it
once you ve replaced the jarfile you can try modifying core site xml to set fs gs reported permissions to something like 755 or even 777 as the permissions note that setting the gcs connector reported permissions to be permissive doesn t actually leak any greater access than otherwise since the gcs access is only conditioned on oauth2 credentials likely via service account if you re on a gce vm
i was getting this error because by typing spark shell usr bin spark shell was getting executed
you are getting this error because you do not have any directory user develop on hdfs
you can see the file name is not great because did not give a split by option or split hash can be datetime or date
use append option and m 1 so it will be like below
however your choice of libraries to load will depend on where your data is
depending on your application and where your data is you may only need to use data frame over sql cassandra or others
in general it sounds like you don t have any application needs right now so you don t have any dependencies
depending on your configuration you may be able to take advantage of a fully configured hadoop or hdfs installation
these specific deprecations are caused by differences between hadoop 1 vs hadoop 2
this is because pig is checking the hadoop 1 values first
the dashboard still doesn t look right though because the metric i want to display isn t showing up in the list of available fields
yes it is expected a date or tdate field type as the timeline is based on a time x axis
other emr users have encountered similar errors when using newer versions of the spark avro library which spark redshift depends on
part of the problem is that hadoop depends upon avro 1 7 4 and the full hadoop classpath is included in the spark path on emr
it might help for us to upgrade hadoop s avro dependency to 1 7 7 so that it matches with spark s avro dependency though i m a little afraid that this might break something else but i can try it out anyway
i failed to solve it with spark executor userclasspathfirst flag because i got linkageerror
here is the solution which solved the conflict for me use intellij s dependancy analyzer maven plugin to exclude avro from all dependancies which cause conflict
setting it just on your master should at least cover driver calls hadoop fs calls and it appears to correctly propagate into hadoop distcp calls as well so most likely you don t need to worry about also setting it on every worker as long as workers are getting their filesystem configs from job scoped configurations
turns out they were down for another reason
as you can call java methods from pig latin just call the one that does the conversion and you get the correct result
adding on top of zero323 answer i think better way of doing this is in this approach you wont miss any jar by mistake in the classpath hence no warning should come
https cwiki apache org confluence display hive adminmanual configuration adminmanualconfiguration hive site xmlandhive default xml template so first of all you must create your own hive site xml file by copying the hive default xml template and then you can use it from spark
i believe it might depend on the distribution you re using
i m using hdp 2 3 2 so my copy of hive site xml in the spark conf folder only contains this
this worked fine for my unit tests on operations but this caused weirdness when using scalatest with jobtest
but if i want to get these filtered results as part of an application rather than run it from the terminal how would i go about doing it
one way to achieve this is to create custom input format by subclassing default inputformat class so that it will allow you to override the liststatus method
long running process whether to shutdown your application or not depends on the use case
i believe the problem is caused by the mismatch of the hdfs port setting between core site xml and hbase site xml
i am guessing that this is what slf4j actually selected since it was the first one found
normally with a standalone jar everything you need should already be in that jar
logs should tell you the exact reason for heartbeat lost
most common reasons for the agent failure would be connection issues between the machines version mismatch or corrupt database entry
possible cause of the problem is that the port 10000 is already in use as mentioned in your comment that hiveserver is already running which uses by default the port 10000 you could change it to 10005 for example when running thrift server
question 1 read the counters part r 00000 is empty because nothing is making it out of your map task
even though orc is the only format to support acid feature in hive and demonstrated better query performance and compression ratio in some benchmarking studies impala doesn t support the orc file format because it was created by hortonworks who is one of their major competitors
vice versa the hive version on hortonworks data platform hdp does not support parquet for the same reason
if you ever see similar problems and your platform is based on any kind of virtualization
i m going to assume the period is a typo in asking the question because your code isn t adding that
you write out the result in the for loop
you have and it should be reference http hdb docs pivotal io hdb install install cli html i would also make sure you have enough swap configured on your nodes based on the amount of ram you have
but you need to have an additional step of parsing it to your datatypes since regexserde accepts string by default
you are seeing error because of use of query option
the reason why sqoop import needs split by when you use query is because when you specify the source location of data in query it is not possible to know guess the primary key for sqoop
because in query you can join two or more tables which will have multiple keys and fields
as per sqoop docs so you have to specify your primary key in split by tag
it must be following the java variable naming conventions and hence has to abide those rules
there are some possible reasons for that using a old version gcc 4 7 configuration error of libhdfs3
to test my words you could try this if you could successfully do that i think there is another reason for your problem
another possible reason is that you use different configuration prefix
following error will occur caused by org apache flink types nullfieldexception field 1 is null but expected to hold a value
the better choice would be to use kitesdk as explained in this example https github com nezihyigitbasi flinkparquet so if you need dynamic schema then this approach won t work because you need to adhere the schema strictly
you should remove the combiner or re write it as a separate class to your reducer so that it takes in text doublewriteable and emits the same types
because its behavior depends on the data distribution
part of the cluster my other answer holds if you mean a machine that is not part of the cluster the answer as jedijs has suggested is to use pywebhdfs simply installl by pip install pywebhdfs the result is a rather long python dictionary not shown experiment a little to get a feeling
because text is not a string direct conversion cannot be done
you are seeing the effects of bash or whatever your shell of choice globbing and expanding the wildcard before passing the argument to the hdfs command
therefore the command that really gets invoked is hdfs dfs ls tmp data xyz csv
since xyz csv does not exist in your hdfs cluster it is reported as file not found
the problem above is due to delegationtoken request permission to kms ranger
sounds like the v4 auth problem which the fs s3a endpoint property should have fixed that clock problems can cause issues too
the cause of this is incompatible versions of the h2o backend and client in this case the client is the h2o python module
since you already have an h2o cluster running that you re trying to connect to probably the best solution is to install a different version of the h2o python module instead of the reverse
with that information you can construct the url for the download page for that version e g or you can figure out the exact location of the whl file as well writing this response made me realize it s not trivial to find links to older releases so i added a jira to fix that
this will create ambiguous result as each machine shall be treated as namenode
thanks to rameshmaharjan
if you have setup fs defaultfs as described linked in the accepted answer but are still encountering the issue which was the case for me the root cause may be different
it could namely be due to the java serviceloader not being able to find the hadoopfilesystemregistrar
in that case you may have to modify the way your executable jar is assembled
i would try depending on beam sdks java core explicitly either start again using one of the archetypes starter can be good too or compare your pom with one generated by those to look for other important differences in your dependencies
yes this was based on performance
actually the new recommender algorithm rawkintrevo talks about exists in an end to end turnkey system based on apache predictionio called the universal recommender
the ur has a port to java but this is not maintained and isn t really needed since about all the options you might need are exposed as configuration parameters and it is very well documented
the ur supports user based item based shopping cart item set based recommendations based on multi modal data using many different user indicators or events
in my case i install spark by pip3 install pyspark and the error caused by incorrect spark home variable
when storing the 1 000 mb file in hdfs it would be broken down into blocks based on our hdfs cluster block size in this example our block size was 100 mb which means our 1 000 mb file would be stored as ten 10 100 mb blocks in the hdfs cluster
the size of input blocks here matters because there is overhead from starting and finishing new tasks i e
spark can also operate in a stand alone mode without a dedicated hadoop cluster so these two are not tied together 100
untested but analytical function should help you as value of the incr column depends on the values of other rows
i would stay away from both numpy and pandas since you will get memory issues in both cases
because the data types are all going to be different per column a pandas dataframe would be a more appropriate data structure to keep it in
because you called kinit with sudo not as yourself
the problem raises from the version of the jackson jar files within sqoop home lib some of them are too old for hive because we need versions older than 2 6
usually it comes due to the older version
as far as i know nothing changed for last 6 month in that area
a job succeeds but it applies compressions in a wrong way instead of compressing file blocks it compresses entire file that is wrong and that s the reason why athena can t query it
first time login password for hortonworks hdp is hortonworks1 it can be change using below steps step 1 step 2 step 3 step4 step 5 step 6 step 7 step 8 final step unset the mysql envitroment option so it starts normally next time now you can login to mysql using password devesh
split sentence by delimiter in my example it is one or more space or comma then explode and join to get n grams then assemble array of n grams using collect set if you need unique n grams or collect list result
specifically your error comes from the mapreduce package spark already includes most of the hadoop ones itself so it s not clear why you re specifying them all yourself but at least put provided on some of them and for hbase spark i doubt that you want a cdh6 dependency because cdh 6 is based on hadoop 3 libraries not 2 7 2
to get started please add provided to the library in sbt file so that it will use the particular library from the classpath of spark installation
you have enough memory though so i would start there and actively monitor the usage via jmx metrics in grafana for example
you even can create both external and managed tables on top of the same location see this answer with more details and tests https stackoverflow com a 54038932 2700344 if you specified location the data will be stored in that location for both types of tables
in that case you shouldn t need to modify any environment variables for it to work
for example based on that earlier init action you may also want to export hadoop conf dir etc hadoop conf
use opencsv to create an external table based on your psv file and call it mytab exterrnal
you can read the csv file with the delimiteryou want and calculate result as below after you get the dataframe df output
it should work but when you use the select you don t use tmp therefore it should work without the drop tmp
in your code you create the wanted string variable but it is not being saved anywhere hence you can t see the result
if you can try to always use built in functionality of spark since it is usually more optimised and better in handling null inputs
you can use simple substr because the date is already in the hive format yyyy mm dd returns or if you want the same format as in the first example yyyy mm dd hh mm ss returns also date format as of hive 1 2 0 function can be used for the same returns and date portion only using date format as of hive 1 2 0
option 1 spark2 2 spark2 2 handles this issue in a better way when compared to other lower versions of spark
option 2 identify the dataframe that is causing the issue
this problem happens due to having too big objects to shuffle
the problem was caused due to heap memory overflow the default value set by cloudera seems to be low after increasing heap to 4g the file was successfully loaded
afaik since array columns are different you need to create array data type arrays array data type like this a other wise i think its not able to determine thease array columns
since you are using maven shade plugin you can package uber jar with target original kafka consumer 0 1 snapshot jar with all dependencies in one umbrella archive and it will be in the classpath so that nothing is missed try this
the unsatisfiedlinkerror exception on java native method raised because of version incompatibility between hadoop version in sbt dependencies and winutils exe hdfs wrapper on my windows machine
in java generics are erased at compile time so the best you can do is if you can to make this better you can subclass tuple to keep a type at runtime and then use that as your parameter to setoutputkeyclass
note i know nothing about hadoop so this may not make any sense there but in general with java generics this is what you do
this would be better than your preferred solution since you are still going thru your map output only once and at the same time it would be in parallel
i abandoned the idea because i had to deserialize java hadoop writables from the stream
you can not return a subclass of a class that was defined in the configuration because hadoop explicitly checks class type specified in setmapoutputvalueclass and the type it receives from mappers
it does so because it needs to serialize deserialize objects you emit from mappers
in standalone mode it isn t strictly necessary for everything to be serializable since everything is in one jvm you have shared memory but i don t remember if the code is written to take advantage of that fact since that s not a normal use case for hadoop
if so that would work in standalone mode but not in pseudo distributed mode or truly distributed mode for that matter
remember that those might not show in all editors depending on the encoding
this write operation however does not happen instantly so that must be taken into account
this depends on what your records are going to look like
due to the aforementioned properties hbase is considered to be strong in read heavy scenarios writes aren t live until they are syndicated while cassandra and other eventually consistent database engines are considered to be strong in write heavy scenarios though cassandra s latest release has seen significant performance gains in reading
see http wiki apache org cassandra api the propagation delay can cause issues as you suggest
you can see that because it has a non 0 size
i know nothing about hadoop but i m going to guess that echo data gunzip doesn t work because data is a line of data and data by itself is probably not in the gzip format
this doesn t answer my exact question but i was able to bypass it by adding jobconf stream recordreader compression gzip to my hadoop command source where i learned this note i am stil curious how to accomplish the above via shell scripting so if it is possible please let me know
in case you need this variable permanently put this into profile file or bash profile based on your operating system
in that case you can simply issue wait and the while loop would be unnecessary
here s a sample pig script that does pretty much what you need pig on aws elastic mapreduce can even operate directly on s3 data so you would probably replace foo input and foo output with s3 buckets too
seems like carriage return difference between unix and windows is causing the problem
have the title of the business be the key since that seems to be singular
you do want to figure out a way to make it unique though since i suppose burger king might exist in more than one place
solved should have beed used thanks to harsh j from hadoop mailing list
to run any of these parameters just create your job extending from mrjob this class has a jobconf method that will read your jobconf parameters so you should specify these as regular options on command line
it might be because hbase cluster distributed is not set or set to false in hbase site xml
even if regionserver at the machine is started it may fail because of time sync
as hbase works on a key value pair where it uses the timestamp as the index so it allows a time skew less than 3 seconds
this is my first answer in stack overflow so please do not vote down
the default writablecomparator would normally handle your numerical ordering if the key was intwritable except it s getting a text key thus resulting in lexicographical ordering
as quetzalcoatl said your comparator is not useful since it is used between map and reduce phase and not after reduce phase
in wordcountvo you can keep both word and count but compare based on count only
using jstack i was able to trace the lock back to i don t know why it causes my namenode datanode services to hang but the solution was to download the latest version currently 14 0 1 and all of my problems went away
since you re running on ubuntu maybe you ran into the same issue in hadoop filesystem getfs pauses for about 2 minutes where hadoop would hang for a couple of minutes if etc krb5 conf was missing
1 this is because of the bug in the fsurlstreamhandlerfactory class provided by hadoop
the loadfilesystems method invokes the serviceloader load filesystem class so it tries to read the binary names of the filesystem implementation classes by searching all meta inf services filesystem files of all jar files in classpath and reading its entries
the class loader supplies the urlstreamhandler object when constructing the url for these jars so these urls will not be affected by the fsurlstreamhandlerfactory we set because the url has already having the urlstreamhandler
since we are dealing with jar files the class loader sets the urlstreamhandler as of type sun net www protocol jar handler
since we already defined the urlstreamhandlerfactory as fsurlstreamhandlerfactory it calls the createurlstreamhandler protocol method which causes to recurse indefinetly and lead to the stackoverflowexception
note that the first statement inside the static block doesn t depend on fsurlstreamhandlerfactory now and uses the default handler for file to read the file entires in meta inf services filesystem files
the path leads to java util serviceloader which then invokes sun misc compoundenumeration nextelement unfortunately the source for sun misc compoundenumeration is not included in the jdk src zip perhaps an oversight because it is in java package sun misc in an attempt to trigger the error through another execution path i came up with a workaround you can avoid the conditions that lead to stackoverflowerror by invoking org apache hadoop fs filesystem getfilesystemclass string configuration prior to registering the streamhandlerfactory
the reason that you are encountering this error could be the data directory where zookeeper stores snapshots and logs is corrupted
your results may vary
i found two reasons for the problem of not a valid jar
you need to do this is because the way grouping works in pig groupbysearchstring would be a bag of group excitelog where excitelog is itself a bag of all tuples matching the group
there s always some overhead in putting together the results of a distributed computation
it might be better than o n lg n in that case
you want to keep the default partitioner and grouping comparator though so work is still distributed the same way and the same values go with the same keys
i don t know if this makes it o n since there is plenty of other stuff going on internally like a merge
if you really want to do this i d strongly suggest looking in that direction
i m putting this here in the hope that it helps you even after so long but also because i have forgotten the solution to this issue several times already
the default input format org apache hadoop mapred textinputformat provides longwriteable text so it must be changed using the inputformat parameter i use org apache hadoop mapred keyvaluetextinputformat which splits info at the first tab or if no such a byte exists the key will be the entire line and value will be empty
since this is a sort that sounds like the behavior you want though i may have misunderstood you
well i went with parsing the binary file in the getsplits method and since i m skipping over 99 of the data it s plenty fast 20 seconds for the planet osm 22gb world file
so holding onto references to the object returned by the iterator is not valid and will produce surprising results
depending on where you installed hadoop you need to add this to your bashrc and then reopen your terminal
errno 139 means that hadoop decided that your script got stuck because it didn t make any output for a long time
you don t need to declare a throwing statement in the main function since it s the entry point and the last method on the calling stack
sbin vs bin is due to my version of hadoop
make sure you have imported correct class i have faced same error unlike above my program was having correct parameters in both classes reducer and reduce test but due to importing wrong class i have faced same error message which is reported above wrongly imported class import org apache hadoop mrunit reducedriver correct class import org apache hadoop mrunit mapreduce reducedriver same solution in case of mapper test if you are sure that your parameters are same in mapper __ class and mapper test
you want to extends textinputformat rather than another class higher in the hierarchy because it already takes care of everything that in done at this level and you could need compression non splitable format etc
i don t remember the cause but i think it was some problem with java version i don t check that
you could read below some benefits makes your hive query more readable avoid duplicated code if you need this operation in other queries makes more scalable your systems because you can update this method whenever you want delegate the complex operations to java code and consequently you will be able to test those complex parts
the problem is caused by missing or conflicting dependencies add hadoop auth to your classpath if the problem still arises remove hadoop core from your classpath
thanks to all
the cause of the error is namenode in safe mode
i catch the problem which was causing this error by default hive create tables according to your configuration of namenode i e hdfs localhost 9000 user hive warehouse
since its working fine with localhost i would suggest adding your ip address in the etc hosts file
the current solution of opening up ports is not a good idea because hadoop status pages are served via http not https which means that they are served in plain text and hence anyone on the internet can also access your instance and view or take control of your hadoop jobs or cluster or the data they contain
hadoop at this time does not serve https to my knowledge so what you can do is create an ssh tunnel and browse via that secure tunnel
the permissions message you are receiving is due to the fact you are trying to access your project from a system the cluster master that neither has the machine permissions defined by the vm s service account to make modifications to your project in this case modify the firewall ruleset nor is currently logged in with your user owner credentials entitled to perform the same task
hdfs does not support file updates so hbase is introducing something you can consider virtual operations and merge data from multiple sources original files delete markers when you are asking it for data
i did not try impala hbase so i can t say anything about performance but hdfs plain files spark impala with avro worked for me spark was doing reports for pre defined queries after that data was stored in objectfiles not human readable but very fast impala for custom queries
oozie doesnt get its hadoop configuration directly from your hadoop install like hive for example but from the core site xml you place in that hadoop conf folder
but did not get the reason so its still an open question
changed it to point to where my hadoop configuration xmls are present and then it started communicating with hdfs and hence was able to locate the sharelib on hdfs
the main reason you didn t include the path
note however that since this has to be done periodically it s not exactly a replacement for realtime replication
you can use javasparkcontext to work with spark from java but you still need scala since spark is written in scala
because the java 1 7 java compiler is not capable of creating a class file with the java 1 8 version numbers
because there can be no doubt that that is what has happened
in fact your eclipse compiler is or was compiling for a java 1 8 target because that is what your eclipse settings say that the eclipse java compiler should do
once again i strongly recommend that you learn to use a maven ant or gradle so that you build process is more repeatable and less error prone
in my special case the problem was that the project specific compiler compliance settings were wrong because i used jdk 1 8 locally when i created the project and installed 1 7 later when i got the error on the cluster
i have just searched for your org apache hadoop hbase filter filter and the results are here it shows all the jars that have this file mostly it will be same package with different versions
my original file should be like this those spaces between the data are tab spaces t because this format has that option as predetermined token value for spliting the original lines into several strings
the specifics of creating the dsn depend on your os but essentially you will create it using administrative tools data sources windows install odbc and edit library odbc odbc ini mac or edit etc odbc ini linux
in that case all the big data technology stack leverage upon hdfs characteristic to provide a fast processing of data in a fault tolerant manner
the difference in copying a data within local vs hdfs can simply be attributed to below facts 1 hdfs makes at least 3 copies of data so that it works into highly available manner no matter whether a machine is cluster goes kaput
2 in hdfs the data copies are maintained on different machine across cluster hence some network i o takes place
since the underlying filesystem stores files as blocks one hadoop block may consist of many blocks in the underlying file system
sequential data access means fewer seeks since hadoop only seeks to the beginning of each block and begins reading sequentially from there
you could do a mapside join and then count the results in reduce side
place your small file in the distributed cache so that your data will be available to all the nodes
then do a count in the reducer based on v or interchange the key value pair in the map output to achieve your need
you have already closed the connection of course you cannot read the results
namenode will be in safemode for sometimes after restart if you wait for some time depends on number of blocks namenode will leave safe mode automatically
you have to get rid of the maintenance version number 7 in the spark dependencies because spark core 2 11 exists
i got this error because of the hadoop configuration file named core site xml
it might be possible that your core site xml contains the code given below the error occurred because of the space present between 9000 and value
from looking at the mint forums it doesn t look like mint supplies a default bashrc http forums linuxmint com viewtopic php f 90 t 130358 however bashrc is an optional file so you can add whatever you want to it
hence you should be able to see the users s application log directories on the namenode using the command
pymongo spark is available only on mongo hadoop 1 5 so it won t work with mongo hadoop 1 4
out of my experience these are possible reasons 1 nrt worked initially and if suddenly nrt is not working due to some health issues then there is a possibility of discrepancy in numbers
2 nrt works on wal write ahead log if wal is switched off while inserting the records in to hbase possible for performance reasons nrt wont work
the reason why solr numfound is different from hbase table row count due to hbase indexer make a mistake of deleting some row instead of inserting them
we found this situation according to hbase indexer metrics https github com ngdata hbase indexer wiki metrics we use jconsole to watch jmx metrics data and found indexer deletes count hbase table row count solr numfound finally we debug into the hbase indexer source code and find some code will cause this problem maybe it is a issue about hbase indexer please see https github com ngdata hbase indexer issues 78
i was having similar issue in hive
as we creating a file in local file system i e on creating a directory in it for ex mkdir mithun94 it is a directory entering into that lfs cd mithun90 in that create a new file as nano file1 log
up to my knowledge this limitation has to do with the fact that each partition is stored in a separate hdfs directory so the number of them is somehow bounded in advance to prevent performance issues
exchange is a keyword in hive so you cannot use
either you collect all the data and write your own save method to a single file or you repartition 1 the data which will still result in a directory but with only one part file with the data part 00000
unless we want to do some clever type introspection it is easiest if we create a helper class to annotate the structure of the file next we need some functions to a split the input b extract data from split data c check if row is bad to use these we first need to read in the text file since i don t have it and to allow people to replicate this answer i will create an rdd given this input we can create a dataframe with a single column the raw line and add our split column to it finally we can extract all the columns we previously defined and check if the rows are bad the nice thing about this solution is that the spark execution planner is smart enough to build all of those withcolumn operations into a single pass map over the data without zero shuffling
we also can t define a case class to describe the entire df since you have too many columns to approach the solution that way
i believe this solution can be appropriate since you seem to look for a code with usage of dataframe
the log indicates that hbase has issues with becoming an active master and therefore it starts to shutdown
my assumption is that hbase was never able to start properly and therefore it didn t create the hbase directory on its own
further this would be the reason why the hbase directory is still empty
os centos linux release 7 2 1511 virtualization software vagrant and virtualbox java core site xml hdfs hbase site xml hbase directory owner and permission adjustments result after starting hbase with this setup it automatically created the hbase directory and filled it with contents
it perhaps you format your cluster one more time thus it generate different id cluster in the master node and data node
that s because you can have multiple mechanisms defined inside the section tried from 1st to last and multiple sections with different names in the same config file
pyhdfs library uses webhdfs and therefore webhdfs needs to be enabled in hdfs config
this is when it fails because that domain name isn t understood can t be resolved by your host
you don t need to put null on col3 since hive will put a default value null since it is not in the column list during insert
you can aggregate with count filter the result and join back it is possible to get the same result with window functions but it less robust if data is skewed and on average much more expensive
result of the partitionby clause final result
i had the same issue but the root cause in my case was due to shell script s crlf line separator r n
please try the below and let me know your result
if you don t do that then the file isn t copied into the yarn container s file cache so you will get file not found
if you do that then submit the job go to the dashboard then open the job then click on the definition tab you should see that the graphical tool added a file node into the workflow the important lines are a node like file x y z file causes a hdfs file to be copied from that path on hdfs into the current working directory of the running shell action on the remote data node server where the action is run in a yarn container
on a big cluster any action could run on any node so files must be distributed via hdfs
hdfs is not production ready in k8s yet as of this writing the namenode gives the client the ip addresses of the datanodes and it knows those when they join the cluster as shown below the issue in k8s is that you have to expose each data node as a service or external ip but the namenode sees the datanodes with their pod ip addresses that are not available to the outside world
also hdfs doesn t provide a publish ip for each datanode config where you could force to use a service ip so you ll have to do fancy custom networking or your client has to be inside the podcidr which kind of defeats the purpose of hdfs being a distributed filesystem
what is the results if we change to 0 for both client and server
or what is the bad results
rare failures of some task attempts is not so critical issue especially when running on emr cluster with spot nodes which can be removed during execution causing failures and partial restarts of some vertices
in most cases the reason of failures you can find in tracker logs
and of course this is not the reason to switch to the deprecated mr
try to find what is the root cause and fix it
in this case restarted container may try to copy data produced by previous step mapper and the spot node with mapper results is already removed
in such case some previous step containers are restarted but the data produced may be different because of non deterministic nature of rand function
mappers or reducers can be killed because of many reasons
if the whole job has failed or you have many attempts failures you need to inspect failed tasks logs to find the reason not killed ones
there can be a lot of reasons for the reducers to be killed
but if the reducers are getting killed again and again and your job is in a stuck state because of that then you might have to look at the yarn logs in order to get to a resolution
short answer yes if your job completes successfully then you will see right result
there can be many reasons for a runtime failure of task
mainly due to resources
4 task failure results in dag failure
you can use uuid uuid generated in your system workflow will be also unique in some other system because uuid is globally unique
will check the underlying code since it is very intriguing that it is able to produce unique id even with 500 mappers
since i am using hive 1 1 i could not try surrogate key unfortunately strick s suggestion did not work but thanks for sharing
all rows were tagged with 1 since my cluster by clause had natural key
sort by behavior was similar to order by behavior in results and performance 32 mins to complete
this openjdk 8 242 release is causing more issues
we have been hit by the same problem so i reported it here https bugs launchpad net ubuntu source openjdk 8 bug 1861883 i also reported this to the openjdk bug report site twice but no reaction so far
it also stores the data in a proprietary format blocks etc so external apps can t effectively touch the data in s3
i think you should not execute bin hadoop namenode format because it is used for format the hdfs
vbox supports vmdk since v2 0 afair
vbox ui of virtual media manager changed in 4 0 version so there is no direct option of adding hard disk in virtual media manager there used to be one strange decision in my opinion
although you can create a new virtual machine in virtualbox and in the stage of choosing disk choose existing one vmdk so you don t need to convert vmdk to vdi there is a dropdown but besides also a button to choose a hard disk file not listed yet in virtual media manager
i assume you can establish the connection because the master jobtracker can schedule tasks on the tasktracker
if you spill more than once then you pay a 3x penalty in io due to needing to merge the spills
note that ultimately the amount of ram is limited by the heap size of your java vm so you may need to either increase your cluster size or increase the number of map tasks by increasing the input splits for a given job in order to reduce the number of spills
in your specific example spilled records is larger so you are spilling more than once
your information is not enough to decide what error it is stderr typically in your hadoop temp dir here mapred local userlogs your job id your attemp id stderr sean s answer is the most case when you first use hadoop so i guess you might get a env python r no such file or directory error
when you run the following command grep is the hadoop program which is part of example input is the folder where your source data is and hope you have created it at hdfs output is the folder which will be created as result
is the regular options used with grep program because the output is grep it seems to me that the actual sample application class is not available or missing some info when hadoop command is running you would need to check that first and also look for regular expression if that applies with your input data
i know this is old but in case anyone else has the same problem and sees this so question i want to put up what i did to solve this as it s very simple
subqueries inside a where clause are not supported in hive https cwiki apache org confluence display hive languagemanual subqueries however often you can use a join statement instead to get to the same result https karmasphere com hive queries on table data join syntax for example this query can be rewritten to
looking at the business requirements underlying your question it occurs that you might get more efficient results by partitioning your hive table using hour
just because they are on hdfs doesn t mean that they are in the classpath of the job you are running
the reason is your mrjob jar determines the jars needed for your hadoop client job
basically it is due to java allowing signed 32 bits values as exit code 1 for us but a posix exit status is an unsigned 8 bits value
the reason wait doesn t give you 1 is because negative numbers are reserved for cases when the subprocess exited due to a signal if it exited due to say signal 11 the return code would have been 11
in the mapreduce model you need to wait for all mappers to finish since the keys need to be grouped and sorted plus you may have some speculative mappers running and you do not know yet which of the duplicate mappers will finish first
so if it no longer requires an hdfs input path then you would need to change the code to not require that so you would remove the input path statement
thus this issue occurs if the namenode in core site xml was changed while the metastore service was still running
therefore to resolve this issue the service should be restarted on that machine then the metastore will use the new fs defaultfs for newly created tables such
to get more information on the root cause schematool supports the verbose flag this will print the full stacktrace which in my case indentified the missing database
network communication among hdfs nodes while downloading cannot be avoided anyway since the file will physically be stored in several nodes
that is the possible reason why your second avro worked and the first one failed
it depends on which shell you are using but man can tell you about that
the reason for this is that some distributions of hadoop cloudera hortonworks mapr may include their own java installation for the hadoop application itself
you may not want to create a global environment variable since it may interfere with hadoop hive etc
it may be because of namenode down
depending on your rest needs there may be enough alignment to get what you need
easy way that matches any case calculate md5 hash for each of the rows join two tables based on the value of this md5 hash
short answer instead of using you need to do because in hadoop filesystem instances are shared based on the scheme and authority component of the uri and potentially user group information in more advanced settings and such instances are not interchangeable between schemes and authorities
i faced the same issue at some point and i had to write the command as the following or as the following i believe that it depends on the linux version please let me know if you still face the same problem
editing the answer since i first answered just from memory and it was incorrect
make sure the correct dll is placed in hadoop home bin and make sure this is the one loaded use process explorer you should also see in the log the nativecodeloader output enable debug level for this component and you should see loaded the native hadoop library since your code acts as if the hadoop dll was loaded
the most likely problem is that the wrong one is loaded because is found first in the path
in that case to point to your local os filesystem in the case of for example unix linux you can use something like file home user my file txt if you are using an rdd to read from this file you run in yarn cluster mode or the file is accessed within a task you will need to take care of copying and distributing that file manually to all nodes in your cluster using the same path
add required files during spark submit using files get spark session inside main method since i am interested only in properties files i am filtering it instead if you know the file name which you wish to read then it can be directly used in fileinputstream
spark yarn dist files would have stored it as file home xyz file1 properties file home xyz file2 properties hence splitting the string by and so that i can eliminate the rest of the content except the file name
i had the same problem as you in fact you must know that when you send an executable and files these are at the same level so in your executable it is enough that you just put the file name to access it since your executable is based on its own folder
depends upon what you want to do but scripts like spark home sbin spark config sh or spark home sbin start history server sh can be used
however for someone who comes here because of the same error i post how i have solved
root cause you have used old api fileoutputformat mapred in your job which takes jobconf object as first parameter not job but fileinputformat method you used from new api maprecude which takes job object as first parameter
as s3a is relatively new implementation and works correctly from hadoop 2 7 you need to set two sets properties in hadoop configuration conf is hadoop configuration the reason is that the naming convention changed between versions and to be on the safe side set both
hdfs is the super user here so it has access to all the files but if you want to see the file which has user and group as hdfs through user1 then you can t able to see directly
introduced in hive 0 13 this feature significantly improves query execution time and is easily enabled with two parameters settings 4 cost based query optimization a recent addition to hive cost based optimization performs further optimizations based on query cost resulting in potentially different decisions how to order joins which type of join to perform degree of parallelism and others
simply because you are trying to access to a index in an array which is not that size
properties are the settings you want to change in that file
because the address returned by dns server was invalid hmaster wasn t able to bind
i first tried replacing by since that didn work i looked up the documentation and it seems the file has to be reformatted each line has to be replaced by 1 x lines each starting with the user name followed by one link per line
like patricia shanahan has already noted the objects are being re used the underlying contents of the object is being updated but all the child objects etc are also being reused well that depends on your readfields write methods
one cause of the symptoms would be if values mext always returns a reference to the same object but changes the value of that object to match the next item in the iteration
if you do not have access to its source code you could test for this condition by printing the system identityhashcode for the values next result inside the loop
that should make querying a bit more efficient since the node will figure out which nodes need to be contacted for each query and utilize the efficient internal protocol to do so
since it is only 20gb your es nodes should rarely have to go to disk and can do everything in memory utilize filter caches etc
with many hadoop nodes you can sort of counter the latency effect by having a lot of concurrent requests and a large es cluster should easily keep up with the collective load
for ubuntu the problem is usually because of the association of ubuntu 127 0 1 1
some times the data node may be starting up slowly and this may cause the above issue keep some wait time after the start of dfs and mapred demons
my suggestion is use 1st option because i read somewhere that building native libraries on windows have lot of issues and not preferred on windows
it is basically because of flume home
i got same issue before it s simply due to flume classpath not set
the best way to debug is see the java command being fired and make sure that flume lib is included in the classpath cp as in following command its looking for lib thats where the flume ng jar are but its incorrect because there s nothing in lib in this line cp staging001 flume server conf lib lib
so if you look at the flume ng script there s flume classpath setup which if absent it is setup based on flume home
select cid sum count as total count from count by day where time 1435536000 and time 1436140800 and cid in 4eb3441f282d4d657a000016 14ebe153121a863462300043d group by cid try each change one at a time so you know what the fix is
there were 3 things maybe 4 wrong with my step script needed the script runner jar rather than the command runner jar as we re running a script which i ended up just pulling from emr s libs dir on s3 need to get the hive script from elsewhere so also went to the public emr libs dir in s3 for this a fun one yay thanks aws for the steps args everything after the hive script specification need to comma separate every value in it when in datapipeline as opposed to space separating as you do when specifying args in a step directly in emr and then the maybe 4th included the base folder in s3 and specific hive release we re working with for the hive script i added this as result of seeing something similar in an aws blog but haven t yet tested whether it makes a difference in my case too drained with everything else so in the end my working emractivity ended looking like so hope this helps save someone else from the same time sink i invested
it is possible to reroute the warnigns into another file this way you would get two files one with just the results and another with just the logging information from hive
here s the prototype of your particular method in the documentation in your example that would correspond to based on the format of your wordcounts pairdstream i chose text as the key is of type string and intwritable as the value associated to the key is of type integer
hive can save data in hdfs https cwiki apache org confluence display hive languagemanual ddl or s3 storage http docs aws amazon com elasticmapreduce latest developerguide emr hive additional features html hive doesn t support excel format directly so you have to convert excel files to a delimited format file then use load command to upload the file into hive or hdfs
in hadoop usually files are of large size due to which they are configured for transferring data as soon as they receive some part of it so that they can start processing on it
but due to some reason or may be other job are running on both node 1 and node 2 due to which they are busy thus the map job is now required be perform on node 3 which do not have input file on which we want to perform map job thus that input file is now need to be transferred to this node 3
since 4kb will be transferred more quickly and as soon as node 3 will receive it
if you will look into hadoop streaming data is required to be continuously streaming that is why 4 kb data is transferred between various data node to keep the transfer short and fast and this is also one of major reason why spark streaming is preferred over hadoop streaming because hadoop do not transfer continuous data it transfer very small chunk of data that seems like continuous
http docs aws amazon com amazons3 latest dev using with s3 actions html the access could also be denied because of a bucket policy on set on the s3 bucket you are trying to access
in that case you ll also need to verify vpc endpoint policies as well
they don t support the apache one so any option with fs s3a at the beginning isn t going to have any effect whatsoever
so what i would recommend doing is make your own variation on textinputformat linerecordreader linereader that reads and extracts the individual parts of your string based on you separator
in your case org apache hadoop hadoop core 1 0 0 test overrides org apache hadoop hadoop core 0 20 2 cdh3u2 compile and hence becomes the nearest dependency
in that case you can add cascading jruby as a dependency in your gemfile
the relevant clause for your pom xml file is as i was doing this in clojure with leiningen i added this to my project clj file instead your version will depend on what is installed on your system of course
i can be confusing because they share classes with same or similar names
faced same error after writing driver class below is the error the method setreducerclass class in the type job is not applicable for the arguments class reason of getting this error after creation of reducer class i have immediately passed the class name in setreducerclass without defining the reducer class
the way to instruct to merge the files may be different depending on the runtime engine you are using
i didn t try rhive because it seems to need a complex installation on all the nodes of the cluster
in the java code run by the driver state that the keytab file must be shipped to each executor with an addfile in the java code run by the executors explicitly create a hadoop usergroupinformation that explicitly gets its own kerberos tgt from the keytab before connecting to hbase note that when used that way the ugi keeps its tgt private it does not show in the cache so that other processes on the same machine cannot reuse it and on the other hand a kinit from another process will not tamper it
the root cause of your problem is gssexception no valid credentials provided mechanism level failed to find any kerberos tgt cloudera troubleshooting guide suggests a solution for this problem you can give a try to the suggested solution
since this pull request is open its changes can also be implemented by subclassing it looks like these changes have been incorporated into hbase s hbase spark module which is a successor to sparkonhbase
one possible solution available since spark 1 6 is to use dataframes with text format and append mode
you can also pass configs in a connection s like my emr conn extra param but refrain from it because it often breaks sqlalchemy orm loading since its a big json regarding job submission you either submit jobs to emr using emr steps api which can be done either during cluster creation phase within the cluster configs json or afterwards using add job flow steps
hence the explicit class name is required to instantiate these classes from the mapper to reducer as is not possible to deserialize byte arrays representing writable instances without knowing class being deserialized into reducer input key and value instance
this requires no set up but the side effect is that the scope of the database is within a single cli invocation or a single jdbc client context
therefore hive metadata is not persisted across multiple invocations of a client or across clients
it seems to use jdbc to connect to the server and thus shares the same metastore
you ve not configured the mapper or reducer classes in your main block so the default mapper is being used which is known as the identity mapper each pair it receives as input is output hence the longwritable as the output key
when mapping i use intwritable but i reduce the values in intwritable format and convert the result to double before using doublewritable in context write
i was also facing the same problem but found the solution this problem occurs due to jar issue since ibm java is constant and this constant is define in class org apache hadoop util platformname but this package structure and class is define in two jars hadoop core hadoop auth but the class present in hadoop core does not have this constant
because it was my first test i removed them to get my code running
this is done by comparing the fields of the instances to compare note that hashcode must also be implemented as it must be conform to your definition of equality two instances that are considered equal according to compareto should have the same hash code and because hadoop requires the hash code of a key to be constant across different jvms
the downside is that cloudwatch metrics are collected in batches typically five minute intervals and hence the data may be slightly delayed or less precise
option 1 on the other hand does require a server but therefore comes with more control to customize the logic of your scaling rules
this is usually caused by they referenced class not being at the referenced location or on the same layer of the project file
this is because hive jdbc jars are not in class path
consider transform which might be slightly shorter because keys are left untransformed
since you ve left tostring unimplemented in your key and value it s using the object class s implementation which is writing out the reference
now that that s in the language it takes away some of the reason for implementing in exists subqueries since the two are semantically equivalent
stop jvm from printing the stack guard warning to stdout stderr because this is what breaks the hdfs starting script
here are three ways to find out hive home from hivecommandline from hive shell this will print same variables as above but you can t use grep here so you will have to find hive home from list of all variables from hive command file itself
put your jar file in the following path so that hive automatically picks it up while restart
the bigquery apis have not yet been fully updated to use standard sql types everywhere so you need to use the legacy convention of type mode instead
the restart process depends on the emr ami version you are using
lzo s licence gpl is incompatible with that of hadoop apache and therefore it cannot be bundled with it
the following steps are tested on cloudera s demo vm centos 6 2 x64 that comes with full stack of cdh 4 2 0 and cm free edition installed but they should work on any linux based on red hat
this is a problem because your textinputformat will interpret these as part of the input
if the objects are non serializable then you need to make sure that they are properly scoped so that each partition has a new instance of that object
this is an example that will fail to serialize the non serializable object the example below will work fine because it is in the context of a lambda it can be properly distributed to multiple partitions without needing to serialize the state of the instance of the non serializable object
in addition to kenny s explanation i would suggest you turn on serialization debugging to see what s causing the problem
hadoop is not a replacement of mysql so i think they have their own scenario every one know hadoop is better for batch job or offline compute but there also have many related real time product such as hbase
i suggest hadoop not mysql cluster for offline compute storage because of cost obviously hadoop cluster is more cheap than mysql cluster scalability hadoop support more than ten thousands machine in a cluster ecosystem mapreduce hive pig sqoop and etc
i suggest hadoop not mysql cluster for offline compute storage because of cost obviously hadoop cluster is more cheap than mysql cluster scalability hadoop support more than ten thousands machine in a cluster ecosystem mapreduce hive pig sqoop and etc so you can choose hadoop as offline compute storage and mysql as online compute storage you also can learn more from lambda architecture
hadoop is more efficient for large data sets that must be distributed across many machines because it gives you full control over the sharding of data
on the other hand hadoop allows you to explicitly define the data partition so that multiple data points that require simultaneous access will be on the same machine minimizing the amount of communication among the machines necessary to get the job done
verify the results
how about this hdfs dfs ls r my base dir path grep tr s cut d f6 8 awk begin retention days 10 last 24 60 60 retention days date s getline now cmd date d 1 2 s cmd getline when diff now when if diff last print 3 where list all the files recursively get only files from the list replace extra spaces get the required columns processing using awk initialize the diff duration and current time create a command to get the epoch value for timestamp of the file on hdfs execute the command to get epoch value for hdfs file get the time difference print the output depending upon the difference proceed once you are sure that above command lists the files you want to delete now instead of doing a print operation in last step you can do what you actually want i e
delete the older files like this hdfs dfs ls r my base dir path grep tr s cut d f6 8 awk begin retention days 10 last 24 60 60 retention days date s getline now cmd date d 1 2 s cmd getline when diff now when if diff last system hdfs dfs rm r skiptrash 3 you just need to change the values for my base dir path and retention days depending upon your requirement here its 10 days
you can name it user if you want and then your queries would look like but as you can see that s a bit ugly so it s probably better to pick a different column name
the reason behind this is that the reducer might receive more input data from unfinished mappers which can change the order it processes its input
maybe it was caused by the hadoop eclipse plugin
you can see if you can read them by and it was safe to delete them because the failed process is responsible to retry the creation of those files again later
and they should be removed because such inconsistency can cause future problems
i get a correct result with this code result is is this what you need
here s how since the reduce input is sorted by key have it accumulate all records for the given key and as soon as it sees a different key emit the count
hadoop is optimized for through put rather than latency so it will process many log files joined into one large sequence file much more quickly than it will many individual files stored on the hdfs
for eg 127 0 0 1 localhost localdomain localhost 107 108 206 64 master abc ubuntu 107 108 208 24 slave xyz ubuntu 107 108 87 81 slave1 qwe ubuntu because during reduce processing it search for xyz ubuntu host name instead of slave
i think it depends on what style result you want sorted result or unsorted result
if you need result be sorted i think hadoop is not suitable to do this work
there are two reasons input data will be stored in different chunk if big enough and partitioned into multi splits
if you do not need result be sorted i think this patch may be what you want support no sort dataflow in map output and reduce merge phrase https issues apache org jira browse mapreduce 3397
according to the manual of hadoop streaming d is a genereic option so you have to put it before any other options
an infinite loop in the mapper or reducer can cause out of memory errors
be it 0 20 2 or 0 20 205 0 and the latter is the only one right now that supports appends
your eof exception is probably because you didn t properly swap the hadoop jars in your hbase lib folder
but based on the output key value types from the mapper reducer the output file can be choosen
the multipleoutputformat generatefilenameforkeyvalue method has to be implemented return a string based on the input key
can you amend the wholefileinputformat from the hadoop the definitive guide so that rather than passing the entire file contents as a byteswritable value you calculate the sha256 and pass that as the value
this might be due to the fact that you re running the ibm jvm
from the map logs you included it looks like you may have the identity mapper configured hence the longwritable coming out as the output key rather than the job defined value of text if this is the case you d need to look into the streaming code for 2 0 0 hadoop which i don t have immediately to hand to see how launching the hadoop streaming 2 0 0 mr1 cdh4 0 0 jar jar with you arguments will configure and run a job
you ll need to write a new record reader class that understands your data and therefore understands which new line characters are candidates for a split location and which new line chars are simply part of the data
couple of suggestions have you restarted the job tracker since you made the changes suggested in the first link
python files aren t executable by default so you will have to tell the python interpreter to run your file echo i love china i love ieee i love python python2 home test mapper py or you can make your file executable by typing chmod x mapper py and then run echo i love china i love ieee i love python home test mapper py
the problem is that if maven doesn t just work then there are complexities in your environment that you don t understand that will cause you problems later
i am using cloudera to manage my cluster so the command i ran was sudo etc init d cloudera scm agent hard restart
since it uses ssd for backing storage
this is because the port assigned for zookeeper server on the prescribed machine is used by some other application or it simply is not available to carry a stream
i guess it depends on what you mean by new api in 1 1 1 at least this is no longer deprecated i think i remember reading that the entire mapred package was prematurely deprecated and this was un deprecated in a later release
because sometimes issue showed in the ui is not very useful
the stripes approach benefits more from a combiner and gave better results in my case
in this case none of the old server side configurations take any effect
generally a decrease in percentage represents failing of map reduce tasks after they have been executed for some time and hence have a positive percentage
commands and thereby requires those to be installed and available on your os s or application s path env var so it may call a hadoop fs ls path shell command when you attempt to do hadoopy ls
the documentation here is misleading since this function does not return results and throw an error at the same time in case of failure
i digged this up because i was confused as well
here is the source code of this function okay so in case of a list of more than a single item it calls getbatchexecutor batch gets that function is defined like so see the comment there which means this function will only raise an ioexception in case of a failure with no further information on results
turns out there is another version of the function batch defined on table that supports this case and the corresponding definition in batchexecutor with this function you pass in an empty results array the size of your batch in and this array gets filled as results come in
in the end if any of the items in the batch fail there will be an exception with details on why they failed but still your results array is filled with results of all items
failed items will be null in that array while the rest contain an actual result
in this case the permissions of newly created files are determined by the umask of user root
furthermore the umask for user hadoop shall be set accordingly
by appending the serialised interval to the job name hadoop knew which reducers to send the map results to
i managed to set up local mode and distributed mode running directly from cygwin however was unable to get pseudo distributed to work nicely due to various cygpath conversion issues between unix and windows path styles
this isn t really an answer but i did realize it was silly to use the distributedcache in the way i was as opposed to reading the results from the previous iteration directly from hdfs
it would help if you can show your logs i have seen sometimes users enter the incorrect port number for the snn which differs in their logs and hence gives connection errors
gzip isn t a splittable compression format well it is if you stack gzip files end to end so i would firstly make sure the block size of your gzip files are the same bigger than the actual file sizes
yes if the datanode dies you ll most probably lost data locality if the block size is smaller than the files for the reason i mentioned in the first sentence but if the block size is the same or bigger than the file then you ll have data locality on any data node that has a replica of that block
there is a section about this issue in the pig faq which should give you a good idea what s wrong
if you have an old pig version 0 9 the you have the option to build a jar without hadoop newer pig versions contain the prebuilt withouthadoop version see this ticket so you can skip the building process
furthermore when you run pig it will pick up the withouthadoop jar from pig home rather than the bundled version so you don t need to add withouthadoop jar to the pig classpath either provided that you run pig from pig home bin back to your question hadoop 0 20 and its modified variant 0 20 append
can work even with the latest pig distribution 0 11 1 you just need to do the followings if you still get failed to create datastorage it s worth to start pig with secretdebugcmd as charles menguy suggested so that you can see whether pig gets the right hadoop version etc
i met the same problem while using hive apache hadoop 0 20 2 the problem is that hadoop 0 20 2 doesn t have these jackson jars in the lib folder so either you add it manually in the hive console every time or you copy all these jars to each machine in the cluster
i think as you are trying to output null as key from the map so you can use nullwritable
you are getting a null value because you didn t include the parentheses in the regex definition
how you do this depends on how you are starting job which you did not describe
the problem probably occurs because you try to use xml like tags within oozie
if you want to convert from csv to avro then do these steps create csv table put file directly into table location using hdfs dfs put or use load data local inpath local path to csv overwrite into table db csv table create avro table use hive to load data from csv table to avro insert overwrite table avro table select from csv table serde is responsible for reading and writing data files it is being used when you create table with some specific serde and selecting or inserting the data
the error message says dest doesn t match so that means it thinks the is part of the argument
hence your map class shall implememnt mapper longwritable text text longwritable
there was one more error in your code using d will not compile as d has no meaning after backslash it expects a special escape sequence so i guess for you the following should work line split 17 matches d
root cause is streaming 2 6 0 jar uses mapred api and not mapreduce api
the client caches this information about the ip s so that it doesnt have to contact the zookeeper again
this is a known issue in nutch
this can be caused due to various reasons for us this error occurred while loading data into external tables
data contains date column with data containing dates older than 1970 01 01 and later to 2038 01 18 which was causing this error
because both does the same work
there is a problem due to incompatibility with serde jar inside sandbox
no this isn t because of out of memory else the logs would have clearly mentioned that
its look like your sale amt column is in string so you need to typecast this column to long or double before using sum function
2 you should not use store as variable bcoz it is reserved keyword in pig so you have to rename this variable to different name otherwise you will get an error
hortonworks has a good post on logging under yarn at http hortonworks com blog simplifying user logs management and access in yarn if you have yarn log aggregation enable set to true in yarn site xml then you can retrieve all relevant logs for an application by running note the application id will match the job id so you would use application 1409220779657 0001
i put it there because the asterisk is not showing up on this editor otherwise
it looks like system badimageformatexception could not load file or assembly is probably because of a mismatch between the loader s net version and your assembly
this is a bug please upgrade to the latest version of impala as it appears to have been fixed since 1 2 3 which is quite old
partitions on an external table is tricky because an external table just points to data existing in a pre existing location folder
for whatever reason the names i use don t get utilized in the output at all but at least i can specify different output folders which gives me enough separation that i can work with
these options specifically are set up in the files youre mentioning core site and mapred site hadoop is very finicky so these details are important when asking questions related to hadoop
since you didn t specify any of the above though im guessing you re a beginner in which case this guide should help you and show you what core site and mapred site should look like in a pseudo distributed configuration anyway hadoop has a quick start guide for almost every version of hadoop they upload so find one that relates to the version and setup you re looking for and it should be fairly easy to walk through
i think that s because you are using source file
i have a 2 node cluster so my etc hosts for master namenode looks like and usr local hadoop etc hadoop core site xml has the following the main thing to note is that i ve commented out the myhostname to 127 0 1 1 association
i also had this issue because my machine had start php fpm with port 9000 so i kill php fpm then restart is ok
adding a dedicated hadoop system user we will use a dedicated hadoop user account for running hadoop
while that s not required it is recommended because it helps to separate the hadoop installation from other software applications and user accounts running on the same machine think security permissions backups etc
option mapred map tasks is not a directive but a hint to hadoop so how did you check actual number of map tasks executed
if the error happens when using search it is because hue is not set as a proxy user as detailed in the documentation
eventually i found out the reason
because of some bad configuration the spark can only work in the standalone mode
as you said you are using hadoop core 1 2 1 the taskattemptcontext is an class in that jar
you can simply run the file in junit and check the result
looking at the hive code from branch 0 11 probably the answer is that it for some reason the colinfo gettype is returning null
oracle requires authentication to download archived versions of java 6 at this time you cannot download them directly with wget as a result
thus in your first configuration 192 168 10 10 maps to mongodb while in the second it maps to localhost
a later pass through this forward map is used to create a backward map and voila localhost resolves to either 127 0 0 1 or 192 160 10 10 depending on the order of two lines
since you didn t specify that in your configuration it must be in the code
the easiest thing would be to add to the server configuration so it binds to 0 0 0 0 9000 and thus listens on all interfaces
based on the activity in that issue it looks like this will be resolved relatively shortly
the cross operation is very expensive in that it writes out every possible pair of records
you have 321 372 records so your data will blow up by a factor of 321 372 when you use cross
since your data is about 6 mb this translates to needing to write about 1 9 tb
but without parallel 10 pig is defaulting to a single reducer probably because of the small size of your input and trying to write all of the data on that single machine
perhaps you could aggressively filter your results immediately after the cross so that pig will throw most of those records away before trying to write to disk
or you ll need to re think your data flow so that you don t need to use cross
hadoop will automatically use the current user s keys and they won t work so it prompts for a password
to whoever may face similar issue in future
it may be caused by several things
when using solr with hdfs data directory is described in directoryfactory block so default datadir should be commented out
it s hard to tell what is going on since you neither share the job itself nor logs but try the following and let us know if this works
the output value is 1 thus the output of the mapper is day serverid 1
yes there are two approaches i m keeping this cloudera specific since this is what you mentioned
there is a guide available here and i think it is not a good candidate to be copied here on stack overflow because it is very long and vendor specific if the document moves the title is installation path c installation using tarballs
probably your profile or bashrc do not setup java home or path correctly and thus the java executable is not accessible
i found spring boot autoconfigure missing so i added following in dependencies in pom xml file
it implements org apache hadoop io writable so it s designed to work with hadoop
i confirmed my idea from the following post hive column as a subquery select however what i think is you can modify your query to achieve what you are trying to get also noted that there in no on clause in your which might result in a cross join creating a cartesian product and taking more time
thus make sure you take care of all of these before creating the jar
and thus you will definitely face issues in that matter
thus to overcome that please delete the line delete the job job new job conf basic word count and include the line below job job job getinstance
please update the question stating the hadoop sqoop and mysql versions so that the issue can be replicated
if this is the case then it could be caused by the org apache sqoop mapreduce progressthread class which uses a taskinputoutputcontext which is not reporting properly to the underlying reporter as described in issue mapreduce 1905
otherwise i would assume it s some issue in progressthread or how sqoop is reporting
the error was due to underscores in column names
i had the same problem you shuold use not because when you use job getinstance conf it will copy the conf you can t use the original conf
the process you will need to follow here is initialise a bloom filter in the setup method of the mapper class the filter object itself should be global so that it can be accessed by the map method later filter new bloomfilter vector size nb hash hash type read the smaller table into the setup method of the mapper
update its because of invalid consumer key secret access token secret and make sure to have the system clock is in sync
based on your requirement subgraph search this seems like a reasonable use case for using the hadoop and mr framework
seems like a problem with rdbms related hive query due to the sql exception
the mix of pig versions 0 8 1 and 0 11 1 was causing the problems avro had nothing to do with it
so do not recommend to implement any type of control file solution based on hdfs
error you getting is because hmaster is not running
the distribution contains yarn spark hive pig sqoop flume etc so it should fit all of your needs
the file is similar to a sequential file in that it contains key value pairs persisted in their serialized form but it s designed to be scanned quickly for sort and partitioning purposes and has an internal only format
i first manually deleted the usr local hadoop folder from all the users if any if you are not able to remove it due to lack of permissions then make sure about the permissions of the folder
make the permission of the folder to sudo and on creating and deleting files so that every user can delete from their instances
could not find the root cause however solved the error using different dependencies
note the default ports are different for different protocols so the command ends up looking like or if you prefer fake values
or use multipleoutputs to send one record each to a different file distinguished by name so the part r nnnnn contain means and length r nnnnn contain lengths for example
the job is failing because your reducer py has a syntax error
since the file isn t in the hadoop filesystem i should run mahout as local
since an export configures a system environment variable in unix an similar command should do it in windows
launching a job in this manner makes use of the webhcat templeton endpoint so rdp is not required
essentially you are in a conflict because you will need both libraries on the classpath at the same time at runtime which is hard task
since you want to explore the single vm issue you are faced with two options
manually would mean having one part of the app in the current class loader and then load the second part from a custom classloader so presuming the write part is offloaded in a separate jar create a custom clasloader which loads the old hadoop jar and transitives where applicable and this separate jar file
dynamically loading plugin jars using serviceloader aother decoupling solution that actually works for exactly this reason is the osgi model which allows jars to have their own separate runtime dependency tree in a pier hierarchy which essentially means that the same class may exist in multiple versions in the vm since it is one classloader to every jar
however osgi is another beast for many other reasons and requires a somewhat steep learning effort to really understand and utilize
with your code when you have more than 3 nodes you will have more than one reducers so the output data will be split into parts more than one files
you can later merge these parts by calling the getmerge command like and get one file in your specified local path with the merged results of all the partial files
this file will have the same results as the file that you get when you have two nodes and hence 2 2 1 reducer producing one output file
apparently this is a bug in cdh running on ubuntu 12 04 due to run mounted with noexec can be resolved as follows
the error log shows that the hdfs uri is not correct so you need to check whether there is illegal format char in your command or the hdfs uri is correct
the power of the ephemeral lock is that if the worker dies for whatever reason the connection is broken and zk guarantees that the lock goes away automatically
thanks to http mail archives apache org mod mbox pig user 201208 mbox 3c79a5bc65bfc37343844d4bb8a05dd3ee0183a649ba opera ex5 ny os local 3e 1 got the answer
for cdh 4 4 you can find the hdfs test classes in artifact hadoop hdfs 2 0 0 cdh4 4 0 tests jar which you can depend on in your maven build for example
the links you provide are for terasort so i ll try to very briefly explain it
though the other answer is kinda correct in that some hadoop sorting algorithms use a combination of quicksort and heapsort mergesort i m pretty sure you mean mergesort not heapsort
if you can able to access the full log stack and share the exact details might get the real cause of this problem
there might be other reasons too but we can look out there once we get full log stack
this is usually caused by insufficient space
please check the total capacity of your cluster and used remaining ratio using also check dfs datanode du reserved in the hdfs site xml if this value is larger than your remained capacity look for other possible causes explained here
the cause was that the yarn and hadoop scripts add the config dir i e
now when you create the hbase config two files are loaded hbase default xml this is part of one of the hbase jars so it will always be found
i validated this by printing the classpath from within my application using a snippet like this copied from here and by printing the result of i suspect you have a similar issue
i assume you have localhost on your hadoop configuration files so you need to open etc hosts as sudo and add the following line
i didn t mentioned your conf for no reason it is most likely that cdh 4 2 and 4 6 are not compatible
you ll have to put your documents json files in azure blobs so lucene can index it
additionally to that you can place some meta data into sql server or azure tables that depends on what you are trying to do that point to the blob with the data
the reason for this is either there are no datanodes in your cluster or the datanodes do not know their namenode
this might be the result of namenode format at least twice
i think you should try writing the bad records into different file based on your logic using multiple output
for multiple output you can follow this link multiple output link if you follow this approach you can filter out badrecords and good records based on your logic in map method and your job will not fail
using this approach you can ensure your job does not fail because of bad records and your good records are processed properly
recently i have met a similar problem in my hql i use insert overwrite directory hql out path to overwrite the output but it seems to be unstable which result in repeat items you may clean the output path before the hql and see if the output turn out to be right
this is a general thing which is noticed when running hadoop jobs as the map tasks come towards their finish the results of all map tasks are merged together which involves combine and sorting of the result
while the mapper is still running the combining and sorting starts in parallel and completes as all map tasks finish some maps finish early some take longer depends on the machines resources resulting in delay i would suggest you read the what happens during mapping section of this article i came across while searching for a more technical explanation link i hope you found this helpful
this seems like a regression in functionality because the code to get and display the row counts still exists but it never prints because there are no counters to get the number from
one option is to turn on hive stats autogather which will return statistics but it may or may not have the row count depending on your query
then you can emit all the buffer s contents with the correct score and all the remaining values as they come one by one without the need to use the buffer again since you now know the denominator
i think that printing stack trace is useless i am using this code in your job result you will than see how many of mappers had invalid keyvalue pair
i finally tracked the reason of this problem it turned out that the client at which the file located cannot be access to 50010 port of the datenode as for the firewall
probably the most sensible place to do the conversion is in that first projection to farepclass
since you control the reducer you can do further filtering and output only what you need
a combiner is only applicable if the computation in question allows for partial reduction that is emitting an intermediate result from part of the tuples for the key and using the reduce step to combine the intermediate results
performance scalability of the reduce step greatly depends on how well the key partition function maps unique map output keys to reducer slots
which may be related to jar files because all the required class files were not included
hence include this and then compile and run the code
some thing like this since you need only inputformat so your create table statement will look like this why you need to mention this output format class since you have overwritten the input format hive expects the output class as well so here we need to say hive to use its default output format class
i think your problem is caused by the fact that windows can t invoke a unix native command
brute force error debugging caused me to find the error with the following line specifically with the rmr did not sit well with the environment causing it to crash
that might be causing the issue
a good basic knowledge about different component involved in the mapreduce application can be derived from the courses available on official big data university website such as introduction to mapreduce programming and then try to derive the component diagram basically you need to elaborate the mapreduce execution engine
pigscript output based on your above input samples
well it seems that pair is a class that you have defined since it is not one of the standard hadoop writable classes
however keep in mind that since you are using it as a reduce output value it should also be a class that implements the writable interface
when you store file in hdfs it caused duplication so you have to add timesatmp with file name so fill will be add according to timestamp
the usual reason you d want to do that is to be able to concatenate the results over time as input into a later map reduce job
get the current time ie end time 4 get the time diff and print it so you will get the actual time taken by the pig script
this will cause the manifest file which is contained within the jar that maven builds for you to have the following line added to it now when you use hadoop to execute the jar file you will no longer have to specify the mainclass as you have already done so in the jar s manifest
but your input data is delimited with space so you need to change your script like this
if you submitting a streaming job to hadoop cluster you have to specify the location of the mapper and reducer on the local filesystem using file command line parameter so that hadoop will copy the files to all mappers and reducers so they have access to python scripts
for example hadoop fs put home user files basic mapper py hadoop mappers now your mapper is in hdfs so you can invoke it from the new location hadoop jar share hadoop tools lib hadoop streaming 2 4 0 jar dmapred reduce tasks 1 files hdfs host port user hadoop username hadoop mappers basic mapper py input text output text output mapper basic mapper py be careful because it creates a symlink called basic mapper py and not hadoop mapper basic mapper py
we follow these three steps then the issue in talend was resolved
for some reason it is an undocumented configuration option called spark sql broadcasttimeout by default 300s
for some reason it is an undocumented configuration option called spark sql broadcasttimeout by default 300s so you could try to increase this worked for us or make spark not do a broadcast join even though it is the suggested thing for joining a small table to a large one see https docs cloud databricks com docs latest databricks guide 06 20spark 20sql 20 26 20dataframes 05 20broadcasthashjoin 20 20scala html
due to this the tasks were running out of connections since each of the 280 would try to spawn a connection and 280 the existing 70 is 300
i went with 1 since i control the database and jacked up max connections to 400 and moved on with life
fwiw it looks like 2 is do able with the following but i couldn t test it since i don t control the hdfs cluster https hadoop apache org docs r1 0 4 mapred default html mapred jobtracker maxtasks per job
otherwise it tries to read the entire results into memory at same time and runs out of memory if the results are too large for available memory
you only look at the query result and not interested in the query history etc you can just restart periodically
it should be noted that once we did this we converted the data to avro as fast as possible so we didn t need to explain to every user and the user s baby brother to set the eol line delimiter
i have worked it out by using the option during the extract hive delims replacement in sqoop so the characters n 001 r are removed from the columns
no a table or partition has exactly one directory location on hdfs or other filesystem and all files in that location will be considered part of the table
when you insert into one table it creates a new file in that directory
having the same problem here and i think is because we are reading avro binary datums which are not the same as avro files
in that discussion the answer could be either c or d depending on what the question is trying to ask
as far as i am concerned if the node dies in a unspected way it will stop sending the heartbeat to it s zookeeper so you must give enough time to that process zookeeper to ensure the active namenode is dead
on a scenario with only namenode process dying there is another process in that machine failover controller that will notify of namenode death to the passive one that is why it is a fast thing
please take a look at this thread since it is well written
after a few attempts and google search i release it might be caused by the inconsistency between name node and data node
you aren t setting any inputformatter in your job setting and so by default your input formatter is the textinputformatter so it could that the job is expecting a longwritable as opposed to plain object
you can conditionally test the result of get json object to see if it s null and return bad version accordingly
some simple example data and then the results of this query against this data
and this often leads to negotiation about customer cluster configuration or hardware balance because they often don t account their own specifics
it was caused by this bug https issues apache org jira browse hadoop 3733 even though i replaced the by 2f it kept giving the same problem
change dmapred text key comparator options k2 2 to dmapred text key comparator options k1 2 so the records a reducer receives are sorted first by id and then by time
in order to find neighbors efficiently you ll probably want to avoid doing a full cartesian product since it s an o n 2 operation
this is an approximate nearest neighbors approach because it s possible that some of the true nearest neighbors for any particular point won t hash to the same bucket as the point in question
so that explains my problem
i can also create a custom dboutputformat dbrecordwriter but unless i insert one record at a time there ll always be a risk of one bad record causing the whole batch to rollback
therefore there is no point in having a newline character at the end
since you re working primarily with a repository of audio wav files mapreduce might not be your best option
transformations are being scheduled as tasks by the cluster manager and therefore will not necessarily executed from the executor node that runs your dstream transformation
since you re on a windows box but running under cygwin it seems there s a case of confused identity hadoop thinking it s running under unix and trying to set unix permissions which will obviously fail
the reason it failed when upgrading from 4 0 0 to 4 3 0 was the compatibility
for some reason 4 3 0 was not compatible to be upgraded from an older version of phoenix
since both of your input files are different the read logic varies for both of these
hmm this error makes me think you had a typo in your maven command warning the requested profile native bin could not be activated because it does not exist
your error might be due to loopback address in your hosts file
firewall issue this error might be due to firewall issues
do this in terminal check whether the file is created before continuing since this will be used to restore firewall if something goes wrong
the reason for this eofexception was that flume inserts new line character byte after every event you can notice 0x0a after every record
i m new to this hadoop hive world so i can not answer all your questions but i was able to convert json per line format to orc format following this example
therefore you should use version 2 2 of the hadoop jar files instead of the 2 6 version
however now ambari is causing another problem
i had similar issue but since my source file was small used notepad to covert it to utf 8 encoding
this could be because of the mix and match of the apis
atlast i found the reason it is the disparate treatment of and in the sqoop command when i run from the cli and shell script
header because they don t match the data types you want to impose on those fields
depends on what you want to do
it seems like you want to read an xz file so i would assume you need to setup the input codec not the output one
based on your comments looks to be a dns ip loopback issue
now all user in that group act as superuser hence it works fine
distcp hcatalog hive hive2 mapreduce streaming oozie pig spark sqoop and sharelib properties to your defined user user name share lib by default hdfs location but there is one point important to note here first it creates a directory inside the hdfs cluster share lib lib as of time format like lib 20171230083804 and put the contents of lib inside that newly created directory so the time user runs the oozie job as configured oozie goes to the oozie service workflowappservice system libpath defined value but due to that above mentioned new kind of directory it didn t find any containing libraries inside and throw this kind of below error so here either you define the oozie service workflowappservice system libpath like user user name share lib lib 20171230083804 or using hadoop fs mv move the entire things inside the directory lib 20171230083804 directly to the share lib and thereafter rerun the job again and can verify the sharelib list as below and it will solve your issue hope this will help someone thanks
please add the jar into project class path to avoid caused by java lang classnotfoundexception org apache htrace trace
try arraylist string instead of string because hive sends array as array string not string
saving intermediate results in progressive filtering i have never seen this used successfully
i solved the problem it was because of yarn scheduler capacity maximum am resource percent property
unfortunately the hadoop system could not locate the right machine at the time of reduce due to my faulty network settings
i guess you want to store the result of this query in hdfs then you need to do the following say the data is to be saved in data folder and in simple text format thenyou need to do this
mapr natively implemented a network file system nfs interface to mapr fs so that any reads and writes from and to a file system whether it be to a local file system network attached storage or a storage area network can read and write data from and to mapr fs
this is also the reason mapr asks for a raw disk during the installation so that it reformats the disk as mapr fs
so since you checked your column count make sure your delimiter isn t in the input
we found the problem one node in hadoop was shaky therefore each time vertica accessed this node the file was empty
i as the user did not change the number of partitions parameter mostly because i simply copy pasted the argument line from their provided readme so that s why the reducer never even started
in my opinion jhm not wrok on hadoop cluster because in each node of the cluster the benchmark want start a own jvm
then you need to create a table based on your required columns
since you use cluster by your data would be sorted globally and distributed so you could always do the select query with these columns as your filter condition
once the oozie job submitted the yarn will responsible for the action to completes the mapreduce
the result can then be written to a friendlier csv and or stored in a table
so that you can authenticate for any user from active directory and run the oozie job for authenticated user
you can do that by the following and assuming your dates are all fairly recent so the string are the same size
based on soundex function on movie name get the total of the views rest of the sql is self explanatory
a simple solution would be to have one reducer so all key value pairs go to it and have it keep track of the greatest key
better approach thanks to thomas jungblut
another problem could be that the reducer has a special if condition that fails for every mapper s output but this should not hold in the case of identity mapper and reducer so i believe the case is the former one
the content of the message element will be logged as the kill reason for the workflow job
a kill node does not have transition elements because it ends the workflow job as killed
link https cwiki apache org confluence display pig piggybank in my case i had used in built piggybank jar with cdh distribution since i didn t had privilege to bypass proxy for online download
i have determined the code necessary to produce the results in this request
and timeout exception implies that the server could be down or due to network issues
please try to repeat the same operation more times and if error still persists there should be another cause
the reason why your intellij doesn t behave the same as hadoop command is because the main class is different
by default pig uses hadoop 0 20 version to so while running pig assumes that you are using hadoop 0 20 so you are getting that error you can run pig with different versions of hadoop by setting hadoop home to point to the directory where you have installed hadoop
i think you didn t override the map method correctly so the default map method has been called and that is why you got an error
then i reenabled the firewall on all machines and i added some firewall rules for incoming requests from my own ip addresses like or if you want to allow an ip range from 0 255 then since i had 3 machines
the reason that is true is because when you use kite sdk to create a dataset in hive what you are creating is a table in hive
so for each chunk of the data there is a job running which leads to lack of resource e g
none of the job could finish because each needs more mapper reducer slots
this might not be ideal because no optimization is done
my comment is too long so i make it an answer although it s not really answering your question not yet anyways
tldr yes you can use akka to do this as well as many other approaches but there are too many unknowns to decide whether it s the best solution quotes because there is no definition of best at this point
since there is type mismatch between inputformat and inputsampler the error is thrown
i actually went with yarn in the end because i figured out having a hadoop stack underneath has some additional advantages i can use hdfs as a source for the data to import into cassandra so i don t have to worry about accessibility of the source files from spark i can write custom inputformats to read the data do pre processing with spark and spill the results to cassandra i think doing the pre processing on the cluster should be faster than on the client
it is happening because of readlink which is installed as coreutils in macos
i had the same issue with hadoop 2 7 1 and fixed it by adding a dependency which provides protocol implementation for standalone mode the name of the class is org apache hadoop mapred localclientprotocolprovider you don t need to set mapred job tracker or fs default name because the standalone runner is loaded from classpath automatically
there are 4 properties in server properties file port host name advertised host name and advertised port and 1 property in producer properties file metadata broker list make sure that broker list is same as advertised host name advertised port comment host name property as it doesn t effect if advertised host name is given
keep in mind that setting this delimiter removes the matching text from the data so your processed records won t have in them
i believe root cannot create directory on the node of hdfs since root user is not a hdfs superuser unless of course you changed it
as per hadoop wiki page to setup on winows apache hadoop has been tested and used on windows server 2008 and windows server 2008 r2 which will also likely work on windows vista and windows 7 due to the win32 api similarities
snappy does not work on rhel operating system as it depends on other libraries clib which are not present on rhel it works with latest linux os
when running a larger set of data about 2 minutes running running in 2 maximum map and 2 maximum reduce can bring about 10 seconds of improvement and this makes some sense
and to me it also looks like the two parameters mapreduce tasktracker map tasks maximum mapreduce tasktracker reduce tasks maximum does not take effect any more though i do not see any document confirming that
then based on this data define a region splits
as far as i know yarn cluster mode cannot be invoked remotely without pyspark submit if you still want your driver node to be executing in that 5th server make sure that your user ipython has the correct permission to access hdfs and other hadoop conf directories you might need to create that user in your other hadoop nodes
the problem was due to derby database i changed it to postgresql and it worked
dataproc indeed configures the mapreduce fileoutputcommitter algorithm version so that the final commitjob is fast
since hadoop client already uses jersey core and jersey client as a dependency might as well use what s existing already
also i upgraded hadoop client to 2 6 0 since the hadoop version i have is 2 6 0
btw i also installed the legacy java 6 runtime for os x 10 11 el capitan provided by apple because i encountered an error message to use the java command line tool you need to install a jdk in the beginning of the installation process
case a case b merging these together with the alternation operator you get thats at beginning at beginning at beginning at end if you re certain your data always looks like your examples you could simplify this to at beginning with an optional leading open paren close paren at end or as stribizhev points out characters equal to tmtowtdi depending on your data
this is a bug in elephas which has been filed as jena 1075 and has now been fixed the bug only affects turtle inputs so you can avoid this by converting your input data to formats other than turtle
the case in which sql database fails so it will be better if one should check first whether for an application
regarding the second problem if we want the same json to be stored into multiple indexes based on the number of tags we simply looped through the tags in the json and change the tag property we added then pass the json again to the collector
i m not exactly sure what you are trying to compute with your udf because your problem description is kind of vague but in all three of your code examples you are trying to pass a relation to your udf which doesn t really make sense input datawithval and interdata are relations
here is an in depth analysis of the root cause
df java line 144 tries to run the command so the default df binary on solaris does not take p argument
hence you will have to use usr xpg4 bin df to make it work
this issue is due to datanode clusterid is not same as namenode cluster id both should be same and then only the datanode will communicate to namenode
when you execute these commands on the console they run fine because hadoop home is set
as such the hadoop classpath is not really the cause of this issue
alternately you could provide it as a libjar so that it can get sent to the cluster with your job
so to answer which operate method will be called depends on the type of second parameter that s passed to the method
i can t verify this because i am getting other error with cluster mode now
hope java scala expert identify the root cause
so it seems phoenixcontextexecutor was causing the loss of the jar but i don t know how
basically the problem as i understand it was that the org apache hadoop hbase util reflectionutils class which is responsible for finding the clientrpccontrollerfactory class was being loaded from some cloudera directory in the cluster instead of from my own jar
but that messed up some other classpaths and kept giving me a nullpointerexception when i tried to initialize a sparkcontext so i looked for another solution
i found that now the reflectionutils class was being loaded from the spark assembly jar and since the clientrpccontrollerfactorywas also included in that jar it was able to find it
after this i encountered a few more classnotfoundexceptions for phoenix classes so i put those classes into the spark assembly jar as well
a coworker told me that usually i should expect to find an hbase directory in my spark assembly jar so maybe i was working with a bad spark assembly jar
number of mappers are decided based on inputsplits and not on dfs blocks
if it s possible to run a mapreduce job which requires the whole resources of your cluster so it will block other jobs until it s finished and if you can control the execution time of its mapper tasks then the tasks of your next job will start one by one each time a mapper task from the previous job is finished
this is easier because the first job can simply do a loop or sleep according to a parameter saved in the input files
you could limit number of initializations at the same time manually using apache curator s org apache curator framework recipes locks interprocesssemaphorev2 mechanism for example see for example how cloudera uses this in batch load jobs to load data to solr https github com cloudera search blob cdh6 2 0 search crunch src main java org apache solr crunch morphlineinitratelimiter java l115 in that particular example they use it to limit number of zookeeper initializations that can be at the same time to avoid bloating zookeeper with a storm of requests from hundreds of mappers
in your example you want to limit number of requests to oracle backend from mappers in this example they want to limit number of requests to zk so it s the same problem
ideally it would be great if hadoop had a way to put a random delay for mappers ramp up for exact same reason
flume documentation should have some example on that as i also got into issues because i didn t spot that serializer is set on different level of property name
large delays have disappeared now that etc krb5 conf is present
by setting the replication level to 4 for some files like the w option causes the command to wait until replication has succeeded
2 adding hbase site xml to your application classpath so that hbase client determines all the appropriate hbase configurations from it
most likely your syntax is causing the exception
it appears to be a limitation issue in hive database hive limit of 127 expressions per table due to a limitation in the hive database tables can contain a maximum of 127 expressions
for sas data loader the error can occur in aggregations profiles when viewing results and when viewing sample data
set hive execution engine mr hint 2 since the exception comes out of the dreadful tez externalsorter beast dig into tez properties such as tez runtime sorter class tez runtime io sort mb etc
like samson said you might want to increase the container size and also i found sometimes the join does lead to the issue because by default the hive converts the join to mapjoin
auth check hive server2 authentication since there has several kinds none nosasl kerberos ldap custom of auth mode make sure you use the proper one
now i see that your data is not in tab delimiter form and that s why it split after semicolon part so to solve this problem i just right a query like this and my output result is this i split it using this because your data looks like this delimiter
the delimiter i used was 073 semicolon so changing the pigstorage delimiter had no effect
without seeing the exact failure in the logs i would guess this is most likely a dns issue since you re using hortonworks com domain
ssh command execution finished host server1 hortonworks com exitcode 1 command end time 2016 03 03 22 38 16 error bootstrap of host server1 hortonworks com fails because previous action finished with non zero exit code 1 error message tcgetattr invalid argument connection to server1 hortonworks com closed
for some reason it wasn t working but i figured it out in case you re interested here you go
a between b and c translates to a is greater than or equal to b and a less than or equal to c so i think it s still an non equijoin
default port for namenode is 8020 so you either specified wrong port in fs default name property or your namenode is not running correctly
caused by java lang classnotfoundexception class org apache hadoop fs s3native natives3filesystem not found you have problem with classpath
in cluster mode the application is executed on one of nodes which probably has their own classpath so either hadoop aws 2 7 1 jar for some reason is not present at all despite the fact that you provide it with jars check if it present on all workers at provided path or there is another hadoop aws jar in classpath with another version personally i think it would be 2nd variant
you don t need specify those aws jars since they are already provided by your hadoop cluster
i faced a similar issue while running the below hive query i performed an explain on the above statement and below was the result
it is probably due to some upgrade or installation issue and tez configurations as suggested by the line 873 in log below
saying so because another hive query on an external table is running fine in my case
though not sure but the error line in the logs that looks to be most relevant is as follows solution it is probably happening due to some open files or applications that are using some resources
pls check https unix stackexchange com questions 11238 how to get over device or resource busy you can run the explain your hive statement in the result execution plan you can come across the filenames dirs that hive execution engine fails to delete e g
this is also the reason why your setup works when you start one of the old zookeepers because they are now 4 alive of 6 possible
if you want the new setup to work you need to remove the old servers from the config so that the quorum only knows about the three new ones
which i corrected thereafter and i want the result in below said aggregation i already developed a maven build tool for printing a number in words and thus added explicitly that jar to my project
field name specification is unnecessary because you have simple array without any field names
basically we import the machine in a very complicated way because the ovf file that is supposed to use for importing doesn t work
you have 8gb ram on your windows machine so i recommend you to spend at least 6 2gb ram for the process
one possible cause is an old stale meta inf file see this spark bug report
if you can t find and eliminate the spec that s causing the problem a work around is to include aws hadoop jars where the spark driver executors can find them see this stackoverflow question
i don t see anything in your stack trace to suggest that it is a database lock issue but this could be caused by not closing transactions so you don t get a deadlock but you are waiting on inserts
i want to add my findings after refactoring the code it worked fine for couple months then this problem recurred we thought it was a hadoop cluster problem so a small fresh hadoop cluster was created but that didn t solve the problem either
try this because this version fits this json schema and you have simple string values not another nested documents
i have found the reason by myself
therefore you should never reference your local filesystem in oozie
so the browser is blocking it as it usually allows a request in the same origin for security reasons
this happened because of an bug in hadoop 2 6 3 in which connection retry in done at two levels ipc and yarn try to use 2 6 4 or download patch it will get resolved
to access the hortornworks sandbox from putty or browser you have to perform 2 steps in network setting as below in picture set adapter 1 attached to nat set adapter 2 attached to host only adapter please refer the steps from the pictures above and it will work because same setting is working for me
that is the reason you are getting above exception
usually this error java lang nosuchfielderror default mr am admin user env is caused by jar conflicts
node update is among one of those which is triggered often and hence assignment of container on given node takes place
in case anyone else runs into this issue i was not able to find a way to use s3 to store the intermediate results of a map reduce task
from your code the only thing that strikes me is should you be doing this instead and i am just beginning to learn java hadoop so i might be wrong
this might be because sometimes virtual box has not properly shutdown or power off
hence i am giving only the high level steps without exact commands as those can be found in the aforementioned links to avoid duplication
the reason may be that some bug in the httpclient jar within hadoop share hadoop common lib in my case i accidentally put a higher version of httpclient within that directory which happened to be the buggy httpclient
like here http prowessteja blogspot in 2015 10 apache hadoop 271 native windows 32 bit html have not used this so i cannot comment
if you want to use the default public ticket instead then change the jaas conf accordingly i e
useticketcache true usekeytab false and no keytab entry and to pass the configuration to java from your r code the easiest way is to set the java tool options env variable before anything else bootstraps the rjava initialization ps on windows the path would look like c path to jaas conf java converts slashes to backslashes automatically that s easier that escaping each and every backslash because of the way r strings interpret final note if any jerk tags this with answers should not rely on links since the aforementioned link points to another post of mine in s o then he she is really a jerk and i will gladly tell him her to his her face loudly and with exotic words
looks like the issue was stemming from the fact that i was testing in a local pseudo distributed environment and the correct avro version specified in my pom xml was not being pulled in
once i ran the same program on emr it worked just fine because the correct version of avro was being used
this issue is caused by the version of hbase client in your pom differing from the jar versions on the server side
in partition tables it will create subdirectories based on partition column it distribute execution load horizontally and no need to search entire table columns for a single records
you probably need to change your oozie config since these are inner static classes to the change is the
this metadata is used to typecheck the expressions in the query tree as well as to prune partitions based on query predicates
and it will work because it s a distribution problem of yarn
based on the description of the problem pass 2 doesn t need to know how many times the value 123 occurred in column 1 just that the value 123 needs to be blanked out
in that case your lookuphash can be made to consume a lot less memory by storing array references instead of hash references
my testing shows that this should reduce memory by 50 come to think of it a list of values to match against is what is required so regex ify it and then using it should be a doddle better yet avoid creating the array references altogether and rely instead on building the regex strings manually this should consume an order of magnitude less memory and then to use it
another reason might be something like this whatever you do please take a backup of your files and check at your risk
this can cause issues when deploying into web servers or any other framework that expects a different version of the servlet api to be available
if your use case involves long running etl jobs run by a single user and hence fault tolerance is the main requirement impala will offer few advantages over hive
if your use case involves multiple users writing concurrent bi style queries for doing analytics and hence low latency is the main requirement impala will always be faster than hive
however since in java8 the scripts are in the ext directory they weren t added to the classpath
try to check the jar specified path i think it is the cause of the issue
you might have a problem because your block size is 128 mb and the file size is 250 mb
you get this exception because you re running the job as user user who isn t in the hadoop group by default and so the driver is unable to access the local dir
okay so me looking around over issues on the github pages of these modules and found someone mentioning abandoning the tar package for tar fs
i suspect this could be due to the insufficient disk space in your machine and in this case i d suggest you to clean up your disk space and try this again from your end
in alternate i d also suggest you to use the syncfusion cluster manager using which you can form a cluster with multiple nodes machines so that there will be suffifient memory available to execute your job
in apache drill bigint has only 8 bytes so you can only use number between 2147483648 and 2147483647 ie maximum number will be 2147483647
since hive 2 2 0 hive on spark runs with spark 2 0 0 and above which doesn t have an assembly jar
mapper will store intermediate result on disk local disk
this object helps to save bandwidth into the cluster because it aggregates data on the local node
now we have to send the data to the reducers in order to get the global result
which reducer will process the record depends on the partitioner
here is where the data get shuffled sorted and since the combiner already reduced the data locally this node has to send only 4 record instead of 9
i have tried the equivalent code in scala and i m able to see the results as needed
you can only run the class examples in eclipse not on the cluster while this question was asked and answered in class maybe i wasn t entirely clear so let me try again
the code i gave you will not run on the cluster because the cluster is using hadoop 2 6 0 compiled with java 1 7
however it will run in eclipse because eclipse is running hadoop in standalone mode and you are compiling using java 1 8
well looking at the error we can see that this error appears when the mrapplicationmaster is starting so it is the mrapplicationmaster jvm that is having trouble linking with your class files
all kinds of errors may then appear because the job startup was aborted but you should ignore those and concentrate on the first error that appears
java version numbers on stack overflow it s a thorny problem for sure but it s good to understand what these messages are a symptom of as they are quite cryptic for some unexplained reason why can t it just tell us in language we would understand
there is an error in your reducer it is overriding ip address depending on values order
hence in the load command all fields are in a reversed order compared to the load command in the question
as mentioned in comment file must be globally visible so it should be in the same path on each machine or in distributed file system for example in hdfs copy your jar to each machine or to hdfs
since hadoop hortonworks and cloudera s documents really lack each specific port and protocol specification that needs should be enabled on every version we finally had to turn iptables off to resolve this
i solved it it was a network problem some of the cluster hosts spark slaves couldn t reach each other due to a incorrect switch configuration
since all hosts can ping each other hosts the problem is gone and i can see active and finished jobs in my spark history server ui again
i didn t noticed the problem because the ambari agents worked on each host and the ambari server was also reachable from each cluster host
however since all hosts can reach each other the problem is solved
this is so because each class is a separate compilation unit so when legioninputformat is compiled the compiler only knows that t is a recordreader nullwritable legionrecord
it is now declared abstract for instantiation it requires you write a concrete subclass with just these few lines in the subclass we know the concrete class of t and therefore the class constructor s so we can instantiate it
on the other hand in your case you don t seem to need it so you may prefer to stay with the weaker return type of recordreader nullwritable legionrecord
this is because generics in java are purely a compile time feature the compiler throws away the generics this is called type erasure so that at runtime there is no such thing as a type variable t so you cannot do new t
when you declare a variable as transient then the variable is not eligible to be persistent so you cannot serialize it
make the architecture flexible and decoupled so that you can easily replace components if needed
that s because you want to preserve the order of lines in result file
most likely it is because of the client s local time zone
by throwing the exception in the method signature you re basically causing the entire mapper to stop whenever it encounters a single bad line of data
however the underlying tar file will also get distributed across the partitions and it is not splittable therefore if you try and perform an operation on a partition you will just see a lot of binary data
the problem you ran into is because of the fact that kafka does not currently support both using manual partition assignment with kafkaconsumer assign and group management with kafkaconsumer subscribe
since you have a cluster with two slave nodes set up do you also have a hadoop filesystem set up
first of all it s necessary to have the data in that format
let s suppose you have to have the data in that format
you should have a really good reason to use distribute by and sort by technical clauses from the beggining time of hive
this is caused because your table is created to read an orc file but the actual file in the table location is in some other format like text
seemingly there is command that removes files from hdfs hadoop fs so we should use it to remove hbase data
there can be multiple checkpoints depending on the time difference that exists between trash interval and checkpoint interval
use appendtofile time taken will be dependent on the number and size of files as the process is sequential
the value you have provided to hadoop tmp dir is a relative path this would change every time based on the path from where the start scripts are invoked
so if the tmp dir changes the namenode s name directory changes and thus the namenode is not formatted error
the problem is with the hive query passed as the value for last value argument this emits the log messages along with the result to last value
thus the exception either add this property to core site xml or explicitly define the directories for storing metadata and data blocks by adding these properties to hdfs site xml note you can do both as well
the other errors are from the services when they are unable to make contact with the namenode daemon because it is not running
according to the offical docuemnt about the differences between hadoop components and versions available with hdinsight hdinsight 3 5 is based on hortonworks data platform hdp 2 5 but hdi 3 4 is based on hdp 2 4
so my suggestion is that you can try to create a hdi 3 4 using the same azure storage account for your current hdi 3 5 without more effects for your needs
jvm executing these classes are not the same jvm as driver program and potentially on different machine altogether so you cannot read local file system from those classes
the reason why this option is not preferred is because for each record that you are mapping or reducing you are reading data from hdfs so you will have major performance issues
ok turned out my original code actually works except for some later bugs but my deployment script had accidentally omitted the actual xml file and i missed it because there was a similarly named properties file
find out distribution of keys in your data does a given mapper access lot of same key if yes then combiner is helping else it has no effect
maybe temp table for result will work
this could also be because the ambari agent in the concerned node is not run as a superuser
basically you need more ram because you have overhead of java running the mapper or reducer task
and while your data might all fit into 5 gb as an example the data structures used in hadoop java to represent that data use more and as that data is processed those temporary data structures that are used to calculate the results will use more still
and since java uses garbage collection all those representations might be using heap until garbage collection happens
obviously the best way would be for spark libraries to expose the applicationreport that they re already fetching to the launcher application directly since they go to the trouble of setting delegation tokens etc
in my case i m calling this helper method from the driver itself and reporting the result back to my launcher application on the side
you can obviously use either prong of this implementation or both depending on your needs and tolerance for complexity extra processing etc
i think you get this error because the pig itself not mappers and reducers can t handle the output
try thus you will see only one record and save some resources
this is because i named the wrong table name
edit if you look at the last line of sqoop command it s a bash script and it uses hadoop command internally to invoke sqoop class so all hadoop related libs will be loaded to sqoop environment if hadoop common home env variable is correct
are you able to execute hadoop commands in this server can you share the output of hadoop common home bin hadoop fs ls if this works this error could be due to compatibility sqoop version may not compatible with hadoop
i too faced a similar issue in past
here is what was needed to make it work because we use hbase to store our data and this reducer outputs its result to hbase table hadoop is telling us that he doesn t know how to serialize our data
inside setup set the io serializations variable you can do it in spark accordingly
in order to control the lifecycle of your streaming application you should consider overriding a listener and stop the context based on your condition
please refer to my answer to this post to understand how to stop the streaming application based on certain condition
we have faced the similar issue in our environment
reason hive is appending your database name to the cte reference created which is causing the issue
edit hdfs site xml where this property is measured in milliseconds and you will get a timeout of 50 seconds because default value for heartbeat interval is 3 seconds and timeout to consider data node as dead so timeout 2 10 second 10 3 second 50 second
the reported amazons3exception access denied did not originate from s3 but from kms
make sure your application jar does not contain any dependencies which may cause this issue
the error is because you are applying query of showing table and assigning to a dataframe
since you are using hadoop hdfs make the following changes hope this helps
find the correct path of installed python3 assume that the result is include python bin argument with in your command python3 movierecommender py python bin usr bin python3 r hadoop items hdfs user lim u data hdfs user lim u item test txt or create a mrjob conf file with this content runners hadoop python bin usr bin python3 then run your program with this command python3 movierecommender py r hadoop items hdfs user lim u data hdfs user lim u item test txt
the error message you are getting is related with the workers not being able to use opencv because it is not installed on the respective machines
hi as per hive documentation you can t change logging property by setting hive root logger via set command because hive reads the logger properties at time of initialization i e prior to opening cli
you probably have it spelled wrong or are pointing to a version of hive that you no longer have installed in that local
data locality is not a rule remote nodes cannot run the program but a goal always prefer the local nodes containing the data to run the process related with this data chunk since transferring the data many gbs is more costly than traferring the code a few kbs
the default value of the property dfs datanode data dir is hadoop tmp dir dfs data and hadoop tmp dir is tmp which gets cleaned up on reboot and thus all your blocks are lost
this bundled library would use whatever os architecture executed the apache hadoop release build so there is no guarantee that it will match your own os architecture
this can be caused by lack of network connectivity or simply the namenode daemon is not running
var spool abrt vmcore 127 0 0 1 2017 06 26 12 27 34 backtrace says something like after running a sudo yum update i had the kernel version since the operating system updates the problem didn t occur anymore
first things first 20 mb files are not large files to hadoop standards you will probably have many files unless you only have a tiny amount of data so there should be plenty of parallelization possible
i realize that this is still quite a conceptual answer but based on your progress so far i feel that this may be sufficient to get you there
the error indicates that the message sent by the client did not contain all of the expected fields so it is incompatible with the server
a client prior to that version would not have included callid in its messages so it would be incompatible with a namenode running 2 1 0 beta or later
the error is most likely caused by a struct containning a lot of fields
an additional complication in this case is that we need 3 separate occurrences of lateral view corresponding to the alpha beta and delta arrays which creates a risk of a full cartesian product in the result set every alpha beta delta permutation would generate a separate row
query result set if further customization is required then you might consider writing your own custom udtf that generates the rows exactly as you need them
in your case bucketing is done on col2 column hence you cannot update the col2
the problem is that you use the reducer as a combiner the output key and value types of the combiner should be the same as the ones of the mapper while when you use the reducer as a combiner it tries to emit pairs of different types hence the error
first before any other means to add you would need to do a join so the elements you want to add are in new columns added to the original dataframe
in any case once you have the relevant dataframe you can write it to json to create the relevant dataframe you have several options the first option which is easiest if you know scala is to use scala in which case you can use the dataset api by creating a case class representing the original and target values and converting accordingly not pretty
the default etc hosts is 127 0 0 1 quickstart cloudera quickstart localhost localhost domain what you want is 127 0 0 1 localhost localhost domain xxxip address of your vm quickstart cloudera quickstart you may want to modify usr bin cloudera quickstart ip as well because every time you restart your vm the hosts file may got reset again
if you are getting corruptedsnapshotexception is due to this reason the snapshot info from the filesystem is not valid
i think this is happening because you are using a mysql reserved keyword desc as your column name
i think this is happening because you are using a mysql reserved keyword desc as your column name so you can change it and try again
i also faced this problem i think the problem is happened in latest version because random forest is not included in classification with cli drivers in here i have solved this problem by running on earlier version of mahout i e
each of the map tasks after processing its share of the input sorts and merges the data based on the compateto method implementation of the map out key class instance
when the processing reaches determined phase each of the reduce tasks based on the intermediary data produced by the map tasks transfers only the files which it is interested in considering that it is only interested in the group a at the moment it will transfer only the files which belong to the group a from all the machines which which actually produced these category files
the reducer performs its own sorting and merging for the aggregated data previously transferred from the machines which were executing the map tasks i e you have files a 1 a 2 and a 3 but since each of the map tasks was independent the sorting order the aggregated data is not guaranteed so the sorting now is applied on the aggregated group of files the reduce task then performs required processing and writes the results to the final location
the operation is repeated for each of the result groups
the below block should have the name as emr configuration only then its recognized correctly by the aws data pipeline and the hive site xml is being set accordingly
check it in setup phase don t check it in map method for every row because each mapper is created for 1 input split
parallelism will depend on the execution plan and assigned resources
however this is not a good practice so you may need to reconsider your algorithm
the context class implements this interface so any mapper or reducer can call to show it is alive and continues to process
as a last resort since you are convinced it s not a good option you could increase that configuration property in mapred site xml
first of all i would suggest to reduce the parallelism unless the data is extremely huge there is no reason of making 1 million partitions
increase the driver memory java lang outofmemoryerror java heap space is happening most probably because of the takesample not able to get 100 items to the driver
based on the partial logs you provided the following line helps to understand a little it is clear the task id 2 instance 0 or first instance failed due to missing class
so it is possible the node or the file system on the node is not available due to some reason
additional details either due to permission or file system issue h2odriver jar is not accessible for any of the mapper and that is the reason your job is not started
so you shouldn t increasing value for parameter yarn nodemanager resource memory mb because there is no resources
consider df holding your data you can write in java you can use different savemode like overwrite append in scala a lot of other options can be specified depending on what type you would like to save
this was due to the acks field in kafka
the possible cause is that the spark executors are not being able to locate the keytab so they are failling to authenticate to kerberos
on your submit you should pass your jaas config and keytab files to your executors using the following options finally since these jaas files are being sent to executors and the spark driver you should use the relative path for the keytab and not the absolute
the line caused by java lang numberformatexception for input string 0000312 0000 shows that you are trying to use a string value as it is numeric
if an absolute path is preferred examining the spark source code reveals that the whole command line including environment variable assignments are subject to expansion by the shell so the expression pwd will be expanded to the current working directory spark yarn dist files home todd pwn connect so spark yarn appmasterenv ld preload pwd pwn connect so spark executorenv ld preload pwd pwn connect so
i believe what you have missed is please post the driver code to find the exact reason
if your outputstream is close error then next time you get append outputstream will occor error with because current leaseholder is trying to recreate file
because the outputstream is not use any more so if you close fail you need to recover the lease by use recoverlease code example is
you ve delcared the classes as inner classes which might be causing issues
because you are connecting to hdfs or hive using jdbc connection
hive use mapreduce and this is the main reason why it s slow but if you want to find more information see the link bellow https community hortonworks com content supportkb 48808 a hive join query is slow because it is stuck for html
the problem was to use the hostname for spark spark master 7077 so inside the spark master is something like this
the application can be submitted to spark rest server which runs on 6066 rather then submitting on legacy system runs on 7077 so the issue got fixed when application is submitted to rest server using the below command now if one spark master is down then application gets submitted to the other spark master
after a lot of debugging i was able to identify that for some reason the jupyter container was not looking in the correct hadoop conf directory even though the hadoop home environment variable was pointing to the correct location
the only tip i received is to check my windows ssh broker and disable it but as far as i tried it can t be done cause it s an integral part to windows
you can include the offset clause with the limit clause to produce paged result sets like 11 20
always use this clause in combination with order by so that it is clear which item should be first second and so on and limit so that the result set covers a bounded range such as items 0 9 100 199 and so on
for some reasons the check env sh script does not properly handle this exception and you get these misleading unrelated error messages
solution i had installed spark twice one standalone version from apache and one from anaconda caused problems with the paths
your issue is probably due the fact that some libraries are loaded by emr yarn flink before your own classes what leads to nosuchmethoderror classes loaded are not the one you provided but the one provided by emr
generally accessing dynamodb from spark is difficult because now you have tied spark executors with the dynamodb throttle
it says that issue is more likely due to your companies it policies which can prevent you from modifying the file permission of hive tmp directory
there are following three different issues in this question hiveserver2 alert following error indicate port 10000 on machine2 ambari local is not reachable either there is no process hiveserver2 running on port 10000 or some proxy issue
error could not open client transport with jdbc uri jdbc hive2 machine2 ambari local 10000 transportmode binary java net connectexception connection refused connection refused heartbeat lost in question it is mentioned that heartbeat lost on the machine this could be because ambari agent process is no more running on host for which heartbeat lost is notified
your application might be failing due to failure during checkpoint as default checkpoint window is 60 but it will be great if you update your question with any exception from logs
you would need something like this replacing projectname with the folder you started docker compose up in i would suggest using docker compose also for the hue container and volume mount for a ini files under desktop conf that you can specify simply since you put hostname namenode in the compose file you ll also need to uncomment the webhdfs line for your changes to take affect all ini files are merged in the conf folder for hue
since you said you tried it without the quotes some thoughts you mention trying adding hdfs are these dependencies on hdfs by any chance
it doesn t seem like it since they have downloads in the path but if they are you won t be able to locate them running pig in local mode
since all the fields are optional in your dataset finding it with a fixed fieldindex is not reliable
an interesting side effect was the datanode reporting multiple times the available disk space wich could lead into serious problems on production
then user can access hive thanks to kerberos security presto thanks to presto ssl password security
and if we grep the location that it wants to find hadoop in hadoop home bin and since i don t have accumulo hive or zookeeper installed these other warnings are just noise
hiveserver2 documentation mentions that when using pam authentication mode if the user s password has expired it will cause the server to go down
a time out on a connection may be just because it s not listening at all on the port or not authorized to be connected
i am not sure what you are trying to achieve but your code would not run on the windows machine because the windows machine is missing hadoop library
sure sentry is used but not all users are automatically given permissions therefore it falls back to the acls applied at the hdfs level given by chown chmod setfacl functions
the issue is occurring since you have specifically referred to the file home hp data gtree txt using fileinputstream which reads from the local file system and not from hdfs
the exception is encountered since spark application code running in data nodes are trying to read this file from local file system
depending on your use case you may have to use hdfs nn port file name to refer to the file
since spark api s are built on top of hdfs api spark can read the gzip file and decompress it to read the files
hence reading gzip files using spark doe not make sense
this could have been caused by encryption type mismatch between kerberos client and server try changing etc krb5 conf on solr server and on client machine add libdefaults section with
the wordcount example code on the hadoop site does not use a package since you do have one you would run the fully qualified class
dfs client use datanode hostname true has to be configured also to the client side and following your log stack i guess 10 0 0 9 refers to a private net ip thus it seems that the property is not set in your client within hdfs client xml
since you are running in cluster you should have this file in hdfs
i m afraid not if i haven t misunderstood you because driver lustre or similar doesn t exist for docker configuration in the same way it exist for nfs for example so if you regard the following schema try with lustre graph driver https github com bacaldwell lustre graph driver blob master lustre graph driver jpg more information in lustre graph driver howto
inconsistency is caused as the table exist in your zookeeper quorum distributed pseudo distributed mode or single zookeeper node for standalone mode but is not present in hbase
default partitioner uses hash function it gives even distribution by design so you won t get any better results unless you know something about the data e g
you can map the columns based on the index as following feel free to modify the above statement based on your column data type
from hive terminal check the proper format of this row may be some special character or some spaces are there because of that this data is not able to parsed
in my case it is because from macos x el capitan the sip mechanism in macos makes the operating system ignore the ld library path dyld library path even though you have already added the hadoop native library to the value of any of these variables i get this information from https help mulesoft com s article variables ld library path dyld library path are ignored on mac os if system integrity protect sip is enable
i just found out that in hadoop 2 x there is not hadoop core so the right pom is
the above mentioned behavior is not a bug rather a feature of spark which will make sure that filter is not happening on the db side rather it is done at spark s end which therefore ensures performance for a non rowkey filter and execution can be finished fast
apparently it is not a configurable behaviour so we can avoid the use of hadoop jar or yarn jar runjar utility by invoking instead with the generated classpath java cp hadoop classpath my fat jar with all dependencies jar your app mainclass 1
on your hbase service in docker compose you did map those port there is no port mapping for port 2082 so your application cannot successfully connect to it
azure blob storage is not supporting this feature so i would expect the behavior
this is a problem with source table xyz because it contains partition __ hive default partition __ hive creates a partition with value __ hive default partition __ when in dynamic partition mode inserted partition value is null
partition __ hive default partition __ is not compatible with numeric type and this causing error because it cannot be cast to numeric type
so either change these column to strings in case class or use if else condition in parsing based on your business requirements
because table can be built on top of location not file
just add bit more steps mention the directory name in datanodes directory so that your cluster gets aware that you have added a new datanode directory
your current user has no authority you can use show file ownership authority use result like the group is divided into user group other the files are divided into reader r 4 write w 2 execute x 1

since you need no fraction you set it to 0
exception java io ioexception too many bytes before newline 2147483648 this is because the maximum size a string can have is 2 31 1 2147483647
i had to add it cause i m working with hdfs in high availibility mode
flume is not writing json so jsonserde isn t what you want
you ll need to adjust these lines flume is currently writing sequencefile containing avro seq org apache hadoop io longwritableorg apache hadoop io text r lx h f h objavro schema and hive can read avro as is so it s not clear why you are using jsonserde
since your job fails when it is in uber mode the problem lies in where the application master cannot access hdfs or those folders in hdfs
this may be due to a missing dll
if you don t have this dependency in your lib folder then i would suggest to use flink fs hadoop shaded as a dependency because it also relocates hadoop dependencies
thus please make sure that you create an uber jar with sbt assembly plugin
there could be two reasons for below exception remote vm hostname ip is not accessible by client machine
there can be many causes for that error it might be due to a wrong configuration of hadoop environmental variables
i would say the problem is that you have imported import org apache commons httpclient uri instead of java net uri that s why you get an error for missing create method which is part of java net uri and you get an error on get method because you pass the wrong type of uri
based on veselin davidov s answer you have to change import to java net uri to the second you use both of a new operator and a static factory method so you have to use the factory instead
looks like the executor is lost because of memory issues
since your db is updated every two hours there is no harm updating it every time afaik
i am also facing this issue but i figured it was due to different java versions
i had originally installed jdk 11 but changed jdk 8 since hadoop 3 x is not compliant with anything after 8 https cwiki apache org confluence display hadoop hadoop java versions
then a request is made to insert data which based on the documentation as a result if the scheme changes the hwc makes it possible to record this data frame in the hive storage where old table with different scheme keeps they data without any exception
i m not sure but maybe webhdfs considers create and write as different permissions so your webhdfs instance is configured to allow only the former but not the latter
in that case it would be an issue with permissions at the webhdfs server
but in hdfs site xml file and other configuration files where should use master s name lidekanfa i used master instead so it warns namenode for null remains unresolved for id null
this lead the problem that after i fixed the problem mentioned above it called me to input the password but the user name and the id didn t match so the hadoop didn t work
because formats with external schema definition like protocol buffers are more space efficient then build in java serialization which produces a very verbose file
path is serializable in later hadoop releases because it is useful to be able to use in spark rdds
i checked the path var log hive but files in that folder are days old
it attempts to calculate the average length of each word but since a reducer only sees a single key then that calculation wouldn t do anything seeing foo 1000 times still has a length of 3
consequently the pop up which appeared every time it was for the reason that the firefox browser could not create the profile related files in the home directory
distinct works good result my hive does not accept 0 preceding i replaced with current row
if you check the source code of distcp in run method will overwrite inputoptions so the distcpoptions passed to constructor will not work
since this application is running in distributed cluster you can t get logs of spark application with redirection
table and data in hive are loosely connected this is very convenient because you can manage data using not only hive and you can create hive table on top of existing data produced by some other tools hive is only one of many tools you can have in hadoop and not necessarily hadoop only
since the issue is solved i d like to post the solution here for further visitors who might meet same issue
this kind of downgrade is not graceful the metastore created before is not consistent with hive 2 3 2 and that s the reason why i met the issue
that being said the console command you must use becomes according to your question it seems like you might want to authenticate using a service principal as well in that case you must use clientcredstokenprovider instead of userpasswordtokenprovider as shown below you could also store the auth info in the core site xml file as it s explained on the hadoop docs
using hadoop superuser looks like its hdfs in your case you need to create an hdfs home directory user rstudio for your rstudio user and change its ownership so that rstudio is the owner
it s due to the failure in the mounted disk in dn
any unhealthy ro or corrupted disk if more than one disk has issue depends upon dfs datanode failed volumes tolerated value the data node going down
any volume failure will cause a datanode to shutdown
sas stores all numbers as 8 byte floating point so you cannot represent integers with more than 15 digits exactly
result so if you have any id values larger than 9 007 199 254 740 992 then you cannot store them as numbers in sas
i think i got the reason i will keep my previous answer undeleted though until you clarify my question below it since you have created your mapper and reducer classes as static classes inside a single class datadividerbyuser you need to specify them in the workflow as in other words you need to replace
action i e foreach in the above scenario is executed invoked on each of the partitions simultaneously in parallel thus invoking the methods that are inside the foreach at last
i tried this before set hadoop user name myuser so i don t know if this helps
i had the same issue which i think is caused because of permission of the folders required to run hadoop
it clearly states the reason for shut down
the reason for this error was as per cloudera manager and os compatibility list rhel 6 10 is not compatible with cloudera manager 5 6 0
you could use the next syntax in order to output the result into a file
once done you can call in existing hive hql using source command here is sample queries by taking your example create table and dummy data validate data into table this is hive hql part to generate statement based on given key and then using source to run query
demo result
solution is to add this jar or dependency to get rid of caused by java lang classnotfoundexception org apache gobblin source extractor extract jdbc mysqlsource download jar from this mvn website
this error is commonly attributed to the fact that you ve not created and distributed passwordless ssh keys
the jobhistoryserver daemon is running in localhost 127 0 0 1 whereas the tracking url is constructed with the hostname thus redirecting to desktop u1eov4j localdomain 127 0 1 1
in that case hadoop will attempt to use the local filesystem for creating temporary files
at first i encounter this message i thought it was the system error and i check carefully it dose not like an error maybe it is a normal message so i follow the document and finish those follow steps messages
i managed to solve this issue the process failed because of the configuration of the filesystem
because in intellij you have some options to shorten your command line
there is no doubt in that
and for vcore usage it will always show 1 because it doesn t calculate it
this is because we want all the consumers to get an equal number of partitions from the topic
since we know that the partition in kafka decides the degree of parallelism that you could achieve
for your 1st problem when you submit a hadoop job application master can get created on any of your worker node including master node depending on your configuration
when you say file emr myfile csv this file exists on your local file system i m assuming that means on master node your program will search for this file on that node where the application master is and its definitely not on your master node because for that you wouldn t get any error
if your core site xml contains value of fs defaultfs then you don t need to put namenode and port info just simply hdfs emr cnsmr accnt bal myfile csv so what s better option here while accessing file in hadoop cluster
the answer depends upon your use case but most cases putting it in hdfs it much better because you don t have to worry about where your application master is
this often is a result of a client that isn t following the http spec properly
sadly it is not possible to achieve because opencsv use single character as escape and really you are trying to use double backslash as escape character which would be a string
https docs alluxio io os user edge en ufs ozone html reference this documents ozone 0 5 0 beta has a bug related the scmclientconfig so you have to add the following configuration into ozone site xml hope this can help you
also suggest listing the files in the directory since your error says it doesn t exist
i had the same problem so i followed the same strategy deleting every file the error mention i just did the same thing you did deleting sandbox repo and copying them somewhere safe for backup
i d like to mention that i just started learning about big data and hadoop ecosystem this method worked and i installed python pip on hdp 2 5 but i don t know if i m going to face problems in the future caused by deleting those files
in my case one of the talbes name was starting with a character underscore because of which there was an issue where 2 single quotes were added automatically in the path of the hdfs directory where the copy of the file was stored
the good thing about the hdfs though is that it does follow a couple of unix based command line conventions so you can really read the contents of a file under this directory which you supposedly have the output of a job by using the cat command like this where the output directory is the name of the directory your desired output is stored and the part r 00000 is the name of the file or the first of a set of files named part r 00000 part r 00001 etc
depending on the number of your job s reducers that you might define with the results of the job
already fixed it the problem is caused by reduce py here s my new reduce py and here is the command line i used to run
the cause for my problem is that cron will not source home bashrc
emr is based on hadoop 0 20 2 do you mean in the context of streaming
you want to set your python scripts chmod a x and test like this cat input svminput1 txt mapper1 py sort reducer1 py because that is basically what hadoop does in streaming is launch the script the os handles executing the script with the right interpreter now for the other files moving into the job for use with your mapper reducer you just add them in through the command line file whateveryouwant like you have with misc py and when your map reduce launches those files are local
you aren t using any try excepts in your code so it will be very difficult to debug what the problem is
most likely parent is null because getworkingdirectory returned null
that s because the number of the reducer that a key goes to is determined as hash key reducerscount
when you have more data they will be distributed more or less evenly so you shouldn t worry about it
that is cause the dependency on libcrypto must now be explicitely stated on these platform when linking to libssl
i think you should be careful about the version you use because according to my experience using difference version can cause difference problems
i would download the pre built windows binaries from here http www barik net archive 2015 01 19 172716 and then follow this official tutorial from apache https wiki apache org hadoop hadoop2onwindows you can skip steps 2 3 2 6 because those are related to building hadoop which you won t need to do if you download the pre built binaries
it is hostname 10 197 34 111 sometimes ip address so createconnection will fail
assuming you re developing on a windows box edit nutch bat and add the following after the rem nutch opts line obviously set the amount of ram within the physical limit of your machine note that nutch can easily require 4g depending on what you re doing with it
depends on you mean by dependent jobs
you need a name node a job tracker a master and then your region servers so you ll be needing a minimum of maybe 5 nodes to run hbase in any reasonable way
numberformatexception is definitely thown by integer parseint so your error must be in the first try when you are computing the clicks and views sum
edit to make it clear for future readers the problem was the usage of the reducer class also as a combiner by mistake thus producing a different output than expected from the map phase
by the time you data come to reduce phase it is already publisher tclicks views format i guess that could be causing problem
then each node takes a task from the queue processes it and puts the result into another distributed queue list or write it to db storage
i can suspect that your dataset is big enough so words happens to appear more then 10 times
please laso make sure that you indeed looking into new results
i see a couple of things wrong with your code sample reset the maxtemperature inside the reduce method as the first statement at the moment you have a bug in that it will output the maximum temperature seen for all preceding key values where are you configuring the contents of year
in fact you don t need to just call context write key new intwritable maxtemperature as the input key is the year you might want to create a intwritable instance variable and re use it rather than creating a new intwritable when writing out the output value this is an efficiency thing rather than a potential cause of your problem
you should do the following please post your main function so that we can verify that
so that you can be very sure that you are overriding the base class method
what you want to be doing is decommissioning the nodes so that hdfs has times to re replicate the files elsewhere
since reducer receives the keys in sorted order it is guarenteed to process the dummy key before any other key
the outline of a solution is pretty straight forward do a word count over your hbase tables storing both term frequency and document frequency for each word in your reduce phase aggregate the term frequency and document frequency for each word given a count of your documents scan through your aggregated results one more time and calculate the idf based off of the document frequency
to find out which port hive server is listening on you can look into your hive server nanny log file present in the log directory whose location depends on your installation or run a simple netstat a command
i believe 10000 is the default port number so it might make sense to try out 10000 directly
the first one is based on hadoop streaming and the second one uses native java
multiple jobs will be sent to the cluster based on the number of lines per job and the size of p that s a fine approach that i have implemented and it works quite well
any reason why you are declaring but not using the serde in your table definition
i can t see any reason to use get json object here
you can output the information as pairs from the mapper hostname info and dedup in the reducer note that cpuinfo will report the number of hyperthreaded cores if you have a compatible cpu rather than the number of cores so a 4 core hyperthreaded cpu will probably show 8 processors in proc cpuinfo
therefore mapreduce is trying to cast the longwritable that textinputformat is giving it to a text and it can t so it bombs out
remember we did not mention which database in hive the table will be created therefore it will be in default database of hive
i am not giving that option since you are just about starting in sqoop
you got a nosuchmethoderror so the first thing to do is check if the programdriver is in the distribution of hadoop you re using
hence there was an exception indicating that the class was not found
when you are connecting to zookeeper it returns hadoopmaster as host instead of the ip address since you put hadoopmaster in your core site xml file
because each core is indexed and written into a hierarchichal folder structure you will have to have some logic in your mapper setup method that might read the meta data from a given core
the proper solution will be to redo your solr indices so that they are sufficiently denormalized and do your joins using a tool like standard map reduce hive or pig
hive would have to completely rearrange and split the files in hdfs because adding the partition would impose a new directory structure
quoting from https developer yahoo com hadoop tutorial module4 html thus setoutputkeyclass and setoutputvalueclass defines the output types for both mapper and reducer
in the current haddop version 2 5 1 but also some versions before it is recommended to use the job class instead of jobconf concluding from the quote and my experience if you have a mapper only job without a reducer setoutputkeyclass has the same effect as setmapoutputkeyclass same for setoutputvalueclass and setmapoutputvalueclass
the problem is that hadoop core version jar depends on some other jars
to the best of my outdated by 10 months knowledge there is no backup to the jobtracker that you can configured so it s up to you to monitor and start up a new one with the correct configuration in the event that it goes down
you need to add them to the hdfs so that they are accessible from all mappers
another way to do it and actually the way i ended up going with is by caching the result of the encryption
it s actually faster this way because with the join you get a separate set of map reduce jobs which slows down the overall execution time
the three major solutions are run fiji using the headless flag use xvfb rewrite the script or plugin in question that said in this case since the script or plugin in question is actually imagej s built in particle analyzer the headless approach should work
probably was complaining that your interpreter first in file something like usr bin php was pointing to an interpreter that didn t exist in that path
however once you computed near keys you can use another metric to measure the similarity between them because minhashing has drastically reduced your searchspace
you essentially need to come up with a function f such that as nearly as possible now exactly how strictly you are able to conform to this is entirely dependent on what exactly the domain of these values is and what your similarity metric is but this is the goal
one possible reason is hive cli and beehive is using 2 different users with different previlage so when you switch users meta store switch automatically if it does not exist already
microsoft posted bug related to hadoop this on this link so i did recreate my cluster and then my issues resolved
your application can tell it to wait but in general is not good to have an idle job so it s better to end the job nicely instead that waiting for the network to work again
this is a generic solution it depends on which is the source of data ftp samba http and its support to download resumes
you could try increasing this property but the default value of 10 is usually enough so there may be something more serious
i remember a case where something similar with fetch failures was due to an incorrect etc hosts file and after googling a bit it looks like this could be the issue so try the following use hostnames instead of ips synchronize your etc hosts across all nodes easier if you use something like puppet try commenting out 127 0 0 1 localhost restart the cluster
quick summary though jersey 1 9 depended on a glassfish maven repo which no longer exists
the reason for error is that build installs hcatalog core artifact as hcatalog core 0 5 0 incubating jar
however because of wrong project version the dependent projects were instead searching for hcatalog core 0 5 0 jar
so there is no need to flush the distributed cache or to remove what you have added with addfiletoclasspath because what you put there is visible only to that specify job instance
you have to give the permissions to that folder too or the full tmp hadoop directory recursively edit figured out that apache isn t a valid user in that case
try increasing the hadoop heapsize parameter in hadoop conf hadoop env sh as the basic reason is shortage of memory required to fork processes
since there can be multiple reducers each one will produce a file in this folder
as a general rule unless you have a very cpu intensive job i wouldn t recommend using multiple threads within the same task it increases the likelihood of issues in your jvm and the cost of rerunning a task would be far greater
open that address and click the links to find more info about the tasks even successful ones since oozie can swallow the hive failure and report success to the task tracker
this is not real answer to the question so if anyone wants to post this as a comment and flag this answer for deletion please do
above error is because you used a mismatched versions of hadoop and hive
my guess is that you have a single key with a huge number of values and the following line in your reducer is causing you problems lets say you had a key with 100m values you re trying to build an arraylist of size 100m at some stage your reducer jvm is going to run out of memory
now because of the last reducer s sorted by key output you are guaranteed that you get the k v pair with the name before you get the other k v pairs for each key
instead of setting the jar by name you can let hadoop determine it for itself by calling setjarbyclass when setting up the job it will set the job s jar based on your class name
and one good thing about capacity is the ability of placing a limit on percent of running tasks per user so that users share a cluster with a quota
if actions i failed then the result i will be null
please note that when the failure inside batch is due to maximum number of attempts to write you need to catch retriesexhaustedwithdetailsexception and call getexceptions to get the array which contains the mapping of the error to the put causing it
as far as i know that memory intensive workload bootstrap action is long since deprecated so may do nothing
choose the configure hadoop action instead if using the console and set something like site key value mapred map child java opts xmx1g if you re doing this programmatically and having any trouble contact me offline i can provide snippets from myrrix since it heavily tunes the emr clusters for speed in its recommend clustering jobs
i usually find ml xlarge is optimal for emr given price to i o ratio and because most jobs end up being i o bound
the version of hive you are running is probably older than the source code on github so you could track down the correct source if you wanted to be sure
accordingly there is a getting started with whirr available in addition there are also related 3rd party tutorials e g
alright so looking at that page you are in the wrong directory
the parent pom was bringing in 1 9 version leading to conflicts with hadoop common jar which was bringing in 1 6 version
this will have the unfortunate side effect of giving up hive s built in timestamp support
due to this you will lose read time checks to make sure your column contains a valid timestamp the ability to transparently use timestampss of different formats the use of hive udfs which operate on timestamps
the last is not a huge loss because only two hive date functions actually operate on timestamps
pre status status post status pre status post status status since you seem to have a difference between the status on input and desired output e g
you should therefore check the log output for you data nodes name nodes and secondary nodes in the cluster that might be causing trouble transferring this data
for example i had an issue where a kerberos principle was not properly being mapped to the hdfs system user due to a misconfiguration in my core site yml file
the following code may work r2 is the final result
use it only if your application needs to process a large number of data records with a mapper and then needs to combine results together with a reducer
do you need to manipulate all of your records consistently and then combine the results
i might have trouble following it but my understanding is that you are inserting into the kpi thm ca rgrp produits jour table results of some query unless they match existing rows
generate say a csv file with the results of the select
if you have to filetr out the records that are already present in your table which is likely the reason why you are using a merge instead of a straight insert you might need to write a simple map reduce job to merge new data with the existing one
this error is because cm can not use apt get install to get the packages
my advice would be to make your unit tests into integration tests this phase in the maven lifecycle happens after package and you ll have a jar by which you can then call setjar and know you ll have a jar built i m guessing here you don t wan to call setjar in the ordinary testing phase because the jar hasn t been built yet
this is very fast at testing a new word against the existing list but also giving a distance measure that is based on the number of operations needed to change the string to the next
you can move the following code to to so that this could get initialized once and for that matter don t need the once condition check anymore
this is because if you release each incoming url record to a thread the next url will be fetched immediately and chances are that when you are processing the last url the same way the map function will return even if you have threads remaining in the queue to process
finally in urlprocessingthread as soon as a url is processed decrease the latch counter probably problems seen with your code at pile addurl currenturl output when you add a new url in the meantime all the 16 threads will get the update i m not very sure because the same pile object is passed to the 16 threads
there is a chance that your urls get re processed or you can probably get some other side effects i m not very sure about that
you should look at the settings of memory management like io sort mb or mapred cluster map memory mb because heap space errors are generally due to an allocation problem and not to map number
if that s the case replace the path accordingly wherever applicable
in file etc hadoop conf hdfs site xml there is one attribute when i made some change i carelessly changed the value to which caused my problem
your best bet is probably to use microsoft s hive sdk also available on nuget as microsoft hadoop hive there is a great sample on how to connect and run a linq to hive query at http hadoopsdk codeplex com wikipage title simple 20linq 20to 20hive 20query referringtitle linq 20to 20hive this used the webhcat api to submit your query to hive and will work against an hdinsights cluster in the azure cloud hence the need to provide a storage key to get the results back again
i was able to get the desired result with the following changes also changed the class names to mymapper and myreducer for this input set i could get the following result computation is same you just need to customize how the output is displayed
namenode keeps the whole file to blocks mapping blockmap in memory so if the blocks you configured is too small the blockmap can grow quite large thus causing the oome
by default join is an inner join so since c does not appear in a it will not be included in the output of j
you are getting because you haven t included some dependent jars in your classpath
as a result sqoop won t work on bare 0 20 at least cdh3u1 or hadoop 1 x is required
checking to see if it exists first doesn t really help at all because that s an extra operation to the namenode
consider the following situation mapper 1 checks to see if dir abc exists it doesn t mapper 2 checks to see if dir abc exists it doesn t mapper 1 tries to create dir abc it does mapper 2 tries to create dir abc it does t so long story short just use mkdirs because it s atomic and doesn t have the above problem and also requires less work from the namenode
after doing the above command run hadoop fsck so that any inconsistencies crept in the hdfs might be sorted out
i got this exact error and after debugging i found out this web server on some data nodes wasnt started due to some corrupt jar file
which would amount to the array bookdata having one element or no element respectively and hence leading to arrayindexoutofboundsexception
i believe the npe is because some element of the array is null
since you seem to be on ec2 it should be something like
about the stream command pig docs hence if you adapt your script to be able to cope with the fact that it gets all data for a group key contiguously it might work out
you are only using 20 of the capacity because you are only using 2 out of the 10 slots
the reason for this is that your job only requires two map tasks
just because you have more capacity this does not mean that your job actually needs that extra capacity
i haven t run any benchmark but i don t think there is too much overhead with processbuilder compared to the libc implementation since it s just to get the groups so the impact is minimal
that being said since it looks like you already figured it out it definitely doesn t hurt using the native libraries for performance improvements in other areas of hadoop
actually your question is not so narrow there could be lot of reasons for this
but what you should remember hive is based on mapreduce engine
make sure you test your jobs thoroughly locally so you feel confident everything works
this is because you will be charged at an hourly rate per machine by amazon even if your job only goes for 30 seconds before failing
if something goes wrong wait a while after the job is done to check the logs because there is a lag
this is probably because with an over partitioned table the query planning phase takes a long time
if you want to store a hashmap you can set that up in the setup function or make it a private object interact with it in the reduce function and then do whatever with it in the cleanup function so it is definitely possible to maintain state across calls to reduce
i ve written about top ten lists a number of times just because i find them interesting and they are very useful tools
in my code i use a treemap instead of a hashmap because the treemap keeps the things in sorted order
the main cause of the problem was that system did not know who i am
i was needed a client of hadoop so the problem was solved by adding client dependency into pom and here is the working example
might be late but i solved this by setting the following parameter to 0 2 mapred job shuffle input buffer percent this tells the reducer jvm in the shuffle space to ask only 0 2 of the heap space rather than 0 7 you are getting out of heap space error because the shuffle space is asking the jvm for memory which is not available to it rather than spilling it just throws the exception but if you ask only for 0 2 chances are you will get the memory also once you exceed the alloted memory the spilling logic comes into picture
i had the same issue because the file was too big for it to be moved to my local machine
the default value uses linux style environment variable references like hadoop home instead of windows style references like hadoop home so you have to override the default value in hadoop home etc hadoop yarn site xml by adding the property like this
the type of the split is dependent on the inputformat so there is no guarantee that the returned splits are a filesplit
the fileinputclass should not be able to split pdf files since they are binaries
the link to the plugin you re using is missing so all i can do is diagnose the symptoms the relevent part of the stacktrace is so there is a missing jar on your classpath
http mail archives apache org mod mbox accumulo user 201312 mbox 3cb9cb2b2bf27f0f46b8ecf781831e00e710970a9f 400015 its exmb10 us saic com 3e i was copying the accumulo policy example to accumulo policy because i thought i needed it in my configuration
then i submitted the python application and got a different error pyenv venv bin python symbol lookup error pyenv venv bin python undefined symbol py legacylocaledetected i used the ldd command to find the dependencies of pyenv venv bin python suspecting that the different installation directories of dependencies for the worker a and the other two workers could be the reason
grigvardanyan based on the image you provided it looks like there is no resolve for the fqdns from the ambari server to the agents
the apache ftpclient used internally ftpfilesystem always sends the user command to the ftp server so it needs some username to use along
you are likely getting the filealraedy exists error because that output directory exists prior to the job you are running
based on the provided information i assume you use hadoop 2 0 0 mr1 cdh4 0 0 4 0 1
at line 844 the npe might occur because ugi is null
therefore call it either manually or use simply which calls init internally
if you happen to use this version you can use the csv serde and specify a double quote as the quote character leading to proper parsing of the data as you specify in your question
split are use regex to do the split string since is a special character in regex means or you need to use instead of when split
since test orc is an orc table the data will be converted to orc format on the fly when written into the table
it seems s hasmoretokens is false from the beginning on therefore lasttoken remains null and hence the numberformatexception null when trying to parse it
because they are in the same directory it doesn t imply they are in the same package
in that case you only have 2 options read all files in your local shell and do the filtering as you did before
the error occurred due to the permissions of folder in which the code was residing
you may want to exclude it from hadoop as well so that you can be sure that the latest of the three 14 0 is the one that gets used
looking at the code carefully no memory leaks are apparent so it seems likely the problem is caused by a single input file that is just too large to process
setting the jvm heap size to 1024 could be running very slowly if it s more than the available memory on the server as that would lead to swapping which is disk i o and very slow
the only way to eliminate a problem caused by a single input file using the same hardware is to change the processing in some way that uses less memory
java cannot find symbol for these 3 methods put get raw it because you keep using htabledescriptor to put get or raw
so you can compare both results using result compareresults like this
thought nothing store specific so i created a simple gist based on spring boot which can be run via its cli
refer to distinct for getting distinct result set now coming to your question join master table with the top row from the result set b
you can change the limit 30 to limit 1 and get the same result
the reason rm r is appropriately frightening is that it s a command you really don t want to mess up since it will delete everything underneath where you start
the r in rm command means recursive in other words everything in that directory and all files and directories included
that would be bad since it s saying delete etc then delete everything under root at which point you re feeling very hopeful that hadoop s trashcan works
instead i used current account for logging
if ping reaches the host check the firewall via iptables on your current machine and namenode because it is probably blocking related traffic
the error that you got is probably due to not having the correct path in args 0 or to having an existing bad path in the job before the part of the code that you have shown
i see two possible workarounds wrap the call to reflect in a sub query so that hive does an implicit conversion to a hive supported type sub query merged at compile time no extra mr step required with the risk that the hive type will still be stringselect printf d wtf from select reflect as wtf from duh require an explicit conversion to the hive numeric type of your choice select printf d cast reflect as int from
powershell interprets the expanded value of env hadoop home as the command to execute which fails because a folder isn t a cmdlet function script file or operable program
there can be multiple reasons for this behaviour
yarn can give you only the amount of executors based on available resources memory vcores
it might be wiser to concatenate the fields together before testing for not in performing sequential not in sub queries may give you erroneous results
when you are providing hdfs app spark will assume that the namenode host name is app so to solve this problem in your code when you are providing the hdfs location you should either provide the namenode s hostname or ip so your code should be temp write format orc option header true save hdfs namenode host 8020 app quality spark test or if you have already configured spark with hdfs yarn by setting the configuration files locations in spark env sh providing the location on hdfs without the protocol hdfs so the code will be temp write format orc option header true save app quality spark test
if only your hive version was more recent you could get a recent driver such as http central maven org maven2 org apache hive hive jdbc 2 0 0 i mean the standalone jar to get rid of your classpath issues although that standalone promise is not 100 true because you still need a couple of extra hadoop jars cf
but oozie runs your sqoop job on random machines therefore the executions are not coordinated
you can devide the query in multiple queries so you just join two tables in every one to get the same result in the last one this will minimize the size of the intermidiate files and should avoid blocking
the numberformatexception is because there is an extra blank space in the line below just after the last t you should replace with after that you will still receive a nullpointerexception in the line that s because you are settng the variable name only in the else block
this is due to the missing hive storage api module in hive exec jar
even your first query select 1 as id tom as name gives error as shown below whereas if we run select 1 as id tom as name from table1 where table1 is the table in my database then we have result as below so above two queries prove that from clause is needed in all select statements
thanks to inquisitive mind
my answer is majorly based on his answer with a little tweak
the concept of distinct is it specifies removal of duplicate rows from the result set
the issue is due to csvloader you are using
since your data also has in some of its field like salary and travel the positional index is getting changed
so if your data is something like this then using csvloader will make a b 10 as the first field 000 23 as the second field and 1357 org type org 2016 as the third field based on you can make your delimiter different so that it is not present in any field value
since teradata jdbc driver 16 00 00 28 you can use connection url parameter column name to control the behavior of the getcolumnname and getcolumnlabel to return the column name column title or as clause name that should resolve your problem
this option has no effect when statementinfo parcel support is unavailable
i aliased the column that was causing the issue using the as sql command
also frame the column value in case when end block the final query may look like please refer replace the empty or null value with specific value in hive query result hope this help you
basically unsupportedclassversionerror because java program was compiled on one particular jdk version higher and running on another version lower jdk version which is not compatible
in your reducer your output value is result which is type mapwritable
if that s your intention you need to replace this line with edit since the mapper output is different from reducer final output you should also set
i believe what was happening was the map reduce jobs were executing on the server in the different timezone thus giving me the weird data offset issue
http my hbase url 12345 dm table examplerow family html you get the following result so if you want to get this result via timestamp e g
because you have different versions of the data saved you can add the timestamp to the url to get the latest dataset with an earlier timestamp
so to get the data set shown above you have to add timestamp 1 to the url this brings the same result as shown above
if this is the only or earliest version calling http my hbase url 12345 dm table examplerow family html 1466667016879 wouldn t find any result and would end in a not found result as described in the question above
if you combine parsing and aggregating summing to a single huge job then it s running time will be of order of days and also chances that it will fail are very high because textual logs are usually hard to parse due to disambiguity
much better idea is to split this job into two separate jobs first job is solely responsible for parsing log files
this job is the place for 99 of all errors because here is where parsing of wild data occurs
this job is parallelizable in the sense that you may split your input into chunks and process each chunk separately so that each chunk is processed in 10 30 minutes
because aggregation code is very simple this job is not likely to fail
sometimes you may be satisfied with result even if parts of input data are dropped out
if your entire job fails the output gets cleared so you loose whatever you processed
if your failure is not recoverable then in most cases it is your fault and you might need to do one or more of the following fix your code even simple bug may cause all your tasks to consistently fail use less resources e g
as an example let s consider that your 8 mb of html text is an ul list with 80 bytes long elements you would have 1 000 000 elements the jsoup element class which is a subclass of node for each li element has the following structure from which we can estimate theoretically and approximately the memory footprint for my example s html list element tag refence to tag object in which 1 string 8 boolean 64 bytes element classnames set of class names 56 bytes node parentnode reference to node 8 bytes node attributes reference to an attributes object 152 bytes contains a linkedhashmap string attribute with 1 entry 48 bytes attribute contains 2 strings 56 2 112 bytes node childnodes list of nodes 3 textnodes because of the b tag approx
also the main ul element contains a list of 1 000 000 references to those li elements in its childrennodes field so it takes 8 mb of memory
the memory explosion happens when parsing the file with jsoup because it has to create lots of objects and java objects especially strings are heavy
it all depends on what your html looks like
you have a good reason to upgrade now
move the data of table a to table c then do a join on table b and table c give your condition and pick accordingly
i have managed to get the resultset after the following patch in hivestatement java for some reason status ishasresultset is returning false even though a resultset is available
the error message i had was similar try running with yarn in client mode instead of cluster mode which prints out the driver program log to your shell spark submit class myclass master yarn path to myclass jar the log output showed that myclass was failing immediately because i had the incorrect number of args the class expected more than 1 arg
the solution for me was to use only what sparks already has apply the answer given in the comments under my question for people who use maven shade delete the hdfs dependency as it creates some kind of conflicts at runtime so no error during the maven build
add hive lib path to classpath in spark home conf spark env sh restart the spark cluster for everything to take effect
it just depends on how it explodes
len 999999999 to avoid side effects defaut is to show only the first 100 matches which may be way too low if you run a lot of frequent jobs
the trick is that you can make a more complex filter such as startcreatedtime 2016 06 28t00 00z endcreatedtime 2016 06 28t10 00z status failed but you cannot request jobs that have failed or have been killed or have been suspended which may result from a temporary yarn or hdfs outage or are still suspiciously running because a sub workflow is suspended for instance
but your program would be more robust since it would be based on structured json input
you can not suspend a coordinator based on the failure of a workflow from coordinator action
use the same file as the first check in your workflow and proceed accordingly
server throws such exception because client sent invalid request or server has internal error or something else
because the code is cleaner and more readable
since tez is an incubator project we need to download the src and build using maven
native hadoop library hadoop has native implementations of certain components for performance reasons and for non availability of java implementations
it is necessary to have the correct 32 64 libraries for zlib depending on the 32 64 bit jvm for the target platform in order to build and deploy the native hadoop library
based on the rule hadoop tables are directories i have created a shell script to do the below steps
find all the directories which are not being modified since last 14 days
separate real tables and real folders 2 1execute desc dir name 2 2 based on return status redirect dir name to two files one for real tables and other for directories now i have the required tables in a file
the following steps will install mssql server jdbc driver to sqoop besides you are using integrated security as far as i know it is not supported by sqoop for sql server so you will get error 3
long story short this specific hdfs permission issue for job history log collection may have different root causes system account mapred cannot be resolved by group mapping rules default config map hadoop user names on local linux users on namenode host and retrieve their linux groups but in turn linux users groups may be bound to ad openldap etc
system account mapred can be resolved but is not a member of the required hadoop system group permissions in the hdfs user history sub directories get messed for some unknown reason e g
the sticky bit switches from t to t without notice a similar issue is described in that post historyserver not able to read log after enabling kerberos diagnosed as cause 2 ps i mentioned the sticky bit flip cause 3 out of personal experience
still puzzled about what caused the change by the way
so it turns out that this is one of those hadoop things that never makes sense no matter how hard you try to figure it out
just because you want to use spark sql it won t make it possible
are you using mapreduce because phoenix queries do not scale
i faced the same issue and want to share my findings so that it will help someone
as for the cause of the problem i just quote somebody s saying these properties are designed for single node executions and will have to be changed when executing things in a cluster of nodes
we can see that in the stack trace where the configuration check in localjobrunner fails this is a bit misleading because it makes us assume that we run in local model you already found the responsible configuration option giraph splitmasterworker but in your case you set it to true
hence the framework decides that you must be running in local mode
since you have enabled the sort merge join property as true this will by default consider the io sort mb as 2047 mb and this might lead to the arrayindexoutofbound exception
so when you set the sort merge join property it is advised to set the sort io mb property also with the optimum value based on your dataset size used in the query
and it is not recommended to use a version different from the hdp stack since the behavior has not been tested and hence unsupported
hi after spending some time debugging got the fix the reason is it was not adding the partition through msck as my partition names were in camel case filesystem is case sensitive but hive treats all partition column names as lowercase however once made my partition path in lowercase it works like a charm
first the reason that you see unexpected end of input is because each recode should be in 1 line like this employees firstname john lastname doe firstname anna lastname smith firstname peter lastname jones now since each row is employees list run the next command give the next output hope this help
most probably due to version mismatch between hbase server and the hbase client jars check your server and client versions
based on the output of your ls command itlooks like igayfvpwrs parquet is actually a directory
caused by java lang unsupportedclassversionerror com mysql jdbc driver in hive client lib change mysql connector java 5 1 17 jar version and try again
it means that you should not use hadoop namenode format but hdfs namenode format instead since it has been deprecated
note action names should have some flag so that each loop action has different name only then the oozie would execute the workflow
to limit to only the top 10 you now need to re sort the results by average age
that means another mapper and a reducer that outputs only the top 10 results exercise left to the reader
hive languagemanual dml hive obviously can t just copy data in case of solr external table because solr uses it s own internal data presentation
that is because you are passing the oozie parameter as well
as the src is external table so you may directly create external table on top of data instead of loading in next step
perhaps if you have a small amount of users in total you could use a set rather than an array since this will automatically distinct your users in the value of the pair as it goes along so it may not grow too huge depends on your data though
the access to hive tables depends on hdfs access rights
also since your table is clustered you need the data to be clustered
accordingly give the m
you are right in that using fileutil copy the streaming is passed through your program src yourprogram dst
q1 mapreduce jobs failing after accepted by yarn reason multiple connections around 130 stuck on port 60487
q2 mapreduce jobs failing after accepted by yarn issue is due to hadoop tmp app hadoop tmp
it s caused by yarn s limitation on task memory usage inside a container
while datanodes will keep blocks of hdfs data the data stored usually is not usable since it will usually be just part of the data blocks in the hdfs
because of this all operations with the hdfs are done through the namenode using hdfs calls like put get rm mkdir instead of regular operating system command line tools
hdfs portmap other health checks on command line hdfs classpath hdfs getconf namenodes hdfs dfsadmin report live hdfs dfsadmin report dead hdfs dfsadmin printtopology depending on if the hadoop cli command works automatically you might have to find the executable to run hdfs
also depending on distro version you might have to replace the command hdfs with the command hadoop
edit i see that you re using windows just change your path notation accordingly
it is also likely since you just formatted your namenode then started that blocks have not replicated yet
it should be in or around usr local hadoop folder depending on your distribution
if your cluster is running you can run the following on the linux terminal you might have to go to the usr local hadoop bin folder to fix the executable if the install didn t update your path to include it hdfs version enable debugging easily for hdfs commands hadoop root logger debug console hdfs dfs ls logs should be stored in var log with a variety of names depending on what services are running on your cluster
also make sure you have disabled any system firewall including iptables firewalld depending on the operating system on all nodes
finally got the cause of this error
yes this error due to java version mismatch but as i have written compiled and exported as jar in eclipse and then this exported jar trying to use in a different version of java here due to version mismatch the jvm could not able to call and find this jar
the hdfs write speed depends on several factors 1 network speed 2 disk i o speed 3 number of data nodes 4 replication factor 5 type of files whether large number of small files or large files 6 namenode and datanode java heap size
the write operation will complete only after replicating to n number of nodes where n is the replication factor so higher the replication factor the write will take longer time
therefore globbing isn t expanding to your desired path name
you will need to do this query for every output directory so that hive will pick them up
i don t have you exact data so it is hard to verify this but i would do something like basically left join the subquery and create a dummy column
spark has no standalone storage layer so there is nothing you can use here
since you mostly data is of type varchar 100
create an rdd of hive lookup table lookuprdd create dstream from kafka stream for each rdd in dstream join lookuprdd with streamrdd process the joined items calculate sum of amount and save this processed result
since you re on windows there is the known issue with ntfs posix incompatibility so you have to have winutils exe in path since spark does use hadoop jars under the covers for file system access
changing writer format for example to json will not work because hive expects sequence files in table created using this option
i don t know what your data looks like in hive because you didn t provide that information so here is how i loaded your xml into hive
records existing in target table partition which do not exist in imported data are those deleted on source database since last sync
restart hadoop process post that you should be able to figure out based on logs of nativecodeloader as why native library is not loaded
from the stacktrace caused by java lang noclassdeffounderror io netty channel eventloopgroup the netty 3 7 0 final jardoes not come with this class
if the executor memory was 8gb and the size of the cached rdd is 3gb the executor will have only 5gb of ram instead of 8gb which might cause the buffer overflow issue you are facing
i guess that increasing the ram allocated for each executor and or increasing the number of executors usually together with increasing the number of partitions might cause the buffer overflow error to disappear
these issues are due to incompatibility of phoenix 4 8 2 with cdh5 9 1
if valuefilter is used on a table with large number of records it takes time at the scanner and causes timeout for the client
this is likely because you have created a new grok parser but have not uploaded the pattern with its supporting patterns to the specified hdfs location
to filter these transient in your spark streaming job you can use the filestream method documented here as shown below for example edit since you are moving your file from local filesystem to hdfs the best solution is to move your file to a temporary staging location in the hdfs and then move them to your target directory
i think that the kerberos authentication fails because your login conf and krb5 conf files can t be found on runtime when using the jar
number of mapper will be dependent on your data size
even though only 10 rows are selected the process needs to scan full data in order to generate results based on group by clause
number of mapper reducer on each step will dependent on data size
hadoop 2 7 2 enumerates all available filesystem implementation classes in jars and fails here due to the transient classpath problems
based on the above exception the input file is not there in the given path file home biadmin pigdata books csv
i was able to properly install it using homebrew credits to this answer now i can find my java folder under library and consequently locate lib tools jar nevertheless i did not remove previous install so i am not sure what this may cause in the near future
i ve just changed the documentation a little bit since unix timestamp values might change during the execution the expression should be evaluated for each row therefore preventing partitions elimination
thus the command is interpreted as fix the hadoop classpath variable the command should work
depending on the installation maybe you need even to start history server
you can try below before downloading file hadoop 2 7 3 tar gz it will show the file type based on that you can try with other commands
usually write end dead means a writer thread failed to close the output stream before exiting but if it s happening in something in the underlying framework rather than any kind of manually created write channel it s likely the result of some transient failure which caused a single task to fail for other reasons and then the write end dead message is just another symptom of the failure
this causing data to move into another column while copying data into csv in hdfs from mssqlserver
you could do that by brute force re create table person20 but not acid partitioned on a dummy col name and with a single partition for dummy populate person20 and person21 create work table tmpperson20 with exactly the same structure and the same dummy partition as person20 insert into tmpperson20 partition dummy dummy select p20 persid p21 lastname from person20 p20 join person21 p21 on p20 persid p21 persid insert into tmpperson20 partition dummy dummy select from person20 p20 where not exists select p21 persid from person21 p21 where p20 persid p21 persid alter table person20 drop partition dummy dummy alter table person20 exchange partition dummy dummy with tmpperson20 now you can drop tmpperson20 could be more tricky with an acid table though because of the bucketing
setting the sticky bit for a file has no effect
so that should fix the problem for you as you can imagine there are already libraries for that commons io for example comes with a method called copy that copies one stream to another
i can summarize a spark job in four main steps 1 initializing spark just to create your sparcontext no parallelism here 2 load data with sparcontext textfile path it exist many way to load your data depending in their type jscon csv parquet this operation will create an rdd t dataset or dataframe in other use cases 3 make a transformation on the rdd t map filter for exemple you can transform your rdd t in an rdd x with your custom functions t x 4 make an actions collect reduce so if you call an action at the end each spark executor will create many threads depends on data repartitions to load transform action
i had this exception i just formatted my hdfs because it was saturated
pay attention please if you format your hdfs you will lose all the meta data related to data nodes so all the information on the datanodes will be lost
actually in my case i am getting 6000 input paths and my map reduce program is going to create minimum 6000 mappers and hence i am getting out of memory exception while submitting
i know this sound weird but i had the same error and i have found the cause
the internal system user uses credentials derived from the configuration such as the instance secret field
it could be an issue due to missing column or wrong column position
thanks to paulbastide i managed to get a connection using the following link i also used the thin client found together with the phoenix distribution
this exception is thrown for multiple reasons visit the link to see is your case mentioned
to answer your question you can read the source code which has logic to invoke combiner based on condition
line 1950 line 1955 https github com apache hadoop blob 0b8a7c18ddbe73b356b3c9baf4460659ccaee095 hadoop mapreduce project hadoop mapreduce client hadoop mapreduce client core src main java org apache hadoop mapred maptask java so combiner wont run if it is not defined or if the spills are less than minspillsforcombine
as most of the hadoop properties are configurable so the behaviour and performance depends on how you configure the properties
it seems like you do not have proper permission to pig temp dir setting and hence this issue
by default pig writes the intermediate results in tmp on hdfs
built in a hurry in a text editor from bits and pieces of a java app i wrote some time ago hence not tested some typos and gaps to be expected
well it s right there your import line is wrong because return inputsplit implementation using org apache hadoop mapreduce lib input filesplit why aren t you importing org apache hadoop mapreduce lib input filesplit
both implementations fulfill the contract of inputsplit so it should be seamless unless some other methods class explicitly requires a specific filesplit implementation
within the foreach you are creating a new variable with the same name so it shadows the existence of the first item
i have had some success writing to hive using the following our attempts to use partitions weren t followed through with because i think there was some issue with our desired partitioning column
the only limitation is with concurrent writes where the table does not exist yet then any task tries to create the table because it didn t exist when it first attempted to write to the table will exception out
run an hourly export from hbase to a partitioned hive table hbase latest version only partitioning is based on ingestion timestamp in hbase
the hourly export may route to multiple tables based on rules
this could be because of multiple schemas in the same topic silo or it could be due to invalid message in which case it is passed to a dead letter table
we may run multiple export jobs for the same topic silo depending on different consumers requirements
every time you call it stringtokenizerwill return the next token which will cause the exception when your program hits the word first in your text because you retrieve first then time and then try to retrieve the next word which doesn t exist causing the exception
but later i found if i make my python code it is building object through some java api which depends on some c api more memory friendly i e
in that case you can point your classpath to that installation s conf dir and lib dirs
the reason for the timeouts might be a long running computation in reducer without reporting the job progress ststus back to the hadoop framework
there s no issue in your output
to make sure you installed it properly so i could remove looks from above sentence is to do the following that by default will trigger loading hive classes that may or may not end up with exceptions on windows due to hadoop s requirements and hence the need for winutils exe to work them around
i know the community mostly advocate using dataframes but depending on the version of spark and your use case rdds may be a better choice
if statistics is not available or may be not available or may be stale for sub partitions then better and safer to use limit 1 for checking data rather than count because in such case count may cause full sub partition scan
in case you are using statistics for count set hive compute query using stats true and statistics is stale then you will receive wrong result
this should run without starting map reduce as a fetch only task you can wrap above command in a shell script analyze result
you can use shell script with hadoop fs for checking folder exists and pass the result to hive scripts if necessary using hiveconf or hivevar variables or conditionally execute your hive scripts from the shell
thanks to david phillips for pointing out this documentaion page
there are different benchmarks on the internet about performance but i would not like to link to a specific one as results heavily depend on the exact use case benchmarked
i m back cause i have just to try again just putting the parameter without any input and it worked that s it
if being a friend is a symmetric relation you can simply do a mapper only job with this logic pseudo code update if this is not symmetric which means that xyz has friend abc not follows from abc has friend xyz then we need reverse records mapper reducer same as mapper before update2 lets see how this algorithm works with your example the result of mapper mapreduce wiil group this values by key so the input of reducer in reducer we do a nested loop by values but skip comparing with self
result this is what we want to get
to get thing work you can 1 find the hive site xml file and configure the property hive metastore schema verification is false so that metastore to implicitly write the schema version if it s not matching
it was solved with this pull request the solutions was like so
in hdfs federation all the namenodes share a pool of metadata in which each namenode has it s own pool hence providing fault tolerance i e if one namenode in a federation fails it doesn t affect the data of other namenodes
day cannot be timestamp since it is not in iso format yyyy mm dd hh mm ss escaping should be done with double backslash the regular expression should cover the whole record in this case end with
since your workflow is being executed using user yarn it is unable to write to that directory
i m assuming this will be a bash expansion since your variables look like bash variables
you re getting a nullpointerexception because none of the text objects in your custom writable are created anywhere
this will cause problems if you re trying to reuse the text objects elsewhere
it looks like you re assuming your records are comma separated strings but in fact they re not when you call println on each one of them they are printed with comma separators simply because that s how list tostring behaves
the results that you generate from this parquet are correct
since your keys are always unique you ll not be able to aggregate them in the reducer
therefore if your dataset isn t extremely large you can write the output from mapper with one common key which will force all the output of the mapper to go to only one reducer
so that it doesn t need to get shipped from the driver to the executors
still the parquet specification allows you to change the compression codec in each data chunk thus you could mix the compression codecs inside of a parquet file
only a pathological batch job would run for more than 24h therefore renewal of the hadoop delegation token is not really useful in oozie
how can you make sure that your app will not be killed because yarn needs resources for a high priority job
but it is probably overkill for simply running your toy app or a plain linux service running on some edge node it s a do it yourself task but not extremely complicated and there are tutorials on the web if you insist on using oozie in spite of all the limitations of both yarn and oozie then you have to change the way your app runs for instance schedule the coordinator to launch a job every 12h and pass the nominal time as workflow property edit the workflow to pass that time to the java app edit the java code so that the app exits at arg 11 58 and clears the way for the next exec
this will get you the same result 2
root cause of the issue the relevant sap vora disk table or relational table has one or more columns of data type string varchar n or char n which are implicitly converted into varchar or char
however sap hana only supports these data types up to a maximum size varchar 2000 or char 5000 and therefore sap hana will run into a runtime exception due to an incompatibility with vora
even in that case it will be much concise than mapreduce code
i am not sure what caused the strange behavior of inittablemapperjob
c3 is illegal alias column name due to the underscore as its first character
crash is due to jdk bug jdk 6675699 this has already fixed in jdk9 and backports are available on jdk8 update 74 onwards
please note that the hive table you are loading to should already exist in the desired location so you can create an external table if you like
depending on your requirement you can use several other write modes that are available like append overwrite etc
that s because you re mixing orc as a storage stored as orc and json as a serde row format serde org openx data jsonserde jsonserde overriding orc s default orcserde serde but not input orcinputformat and output orcoutputformat formats
nsu http 3a 2f 2fopcfoundation org 2fua 2f i 63 represents an expandednodeid so the nifi code should use expandednodeid parseexpandednodeid instead of nodeid parsenodeid
unfortunately i am not familiar with nifi so i am not sure which is the correct approach here
the problem arises from opc ua dualism some services like browse provide expandednodeid references whereas other services like read expect to get nodeid instances
the documentation hints that cron syntax worked with schema 0 2 but i m pretty sure that cron scheduling was introduced in oozie v4 0 and documented in v4 1 and since oozie v4 0 introduced schema 0 4 i believe that the documentation is wrong
examples of user retry in a workflow action is reference user retry for workflow actions since oozie 3 1
in case someone is still having this problem it is probably due to the command line is too long
i faced the same issue due to the command line is too long and fixed it by changing the maven m2 location in settings xml
the hive textfile format relies on mapreduce textinputformat hence all files with a leading dot or a leading underscore are ignored they are supposed to be semaphores e g
the macro variable uid is holding the name of a generic userid different names for the dev and prod environments hence the need for a macro variable
it was assumed that the user existed in hadoop since i was able to use this userid to connect to hadoop from sas and retrieve records via simple queries
because no mapreducer task needs to be built to get that data from the underlying flat files in hdfs
since the home folder doesn t exist for this user the mapreducer object throws an error albeit without generating a log file in hive because there is nowhere to generate the log file or even the task that would create such a file
80k records 10 seconds of cpu time but it took almost 10 minutes due to io from aws
as a thank you to all who viewed this issue and responded i d like to offer an additional lesson learned from this that may be helpful to you since the fields in hadoop are all defined as string sas has to assume that the fields are the longest possible character length 32 767
therefore the amount of data mostly blanks was excessive contributing to the slow transfer rate
the key here is what jvm runs the print line because that is the log on which it will appear
in your case since you are running on yarn except the driver you can see the printout of the driver but not of any code that runs on executors like the map
it was in there because i copied the command from an oozie workflow that was generated by falcon for debugging purposes
after that you need to source the bashrc so that the change take place immediately write in terminal
agent2 channels channel1 type memory also since you already have kafka in your setup use it as flume channel
check that the free local space is enough it seems to be 0 based on your error
this is because your configuration or any abnormal termination of datanode while doing any action on that node there is no internal problem with hdfs dfs put just verify whats inside your directory or use command please specify your problem an error cant be a problem statement until you dont know what you are trying to do
the reason the path works in this command is because this is a shell command
on the shell that you are using presumably it is bash the following commands are equivalent bash removes the quotes and merges the strings together yielding the same string result which is user dev input 08aug2017 student marks details csv
so i would suggest to replace these lines with the following os path join takes care to add a single directory separator on unix on windows between its arguments so you can t accidentally either forget the separator or add it twice
better use ansi join syntax the expected output cannot be the result of your join because for each a id all matching rows from a and b are selected
for the second row from a it will be also two matching rows from b so it will be four rows totally
this is probably because your spark installation is not configured properly to access your hive warehouse
i think you have permission issue in haddop
if you try to run your followup command on that it makes sense that it tries to do something strange and thus fails
i know it is old question but it is unanswered hence adding little information that i know about this issue so that it helps others
this is very common issue we face due to mismatch between the table schema and schema contained in the avro file
so you ve mentioned sqoop therefore i ll point out the proper processes for getting hive xml configuration
therefore both hdp and cdh must have the proper classpath and or symlinks setup
do not compare strings using switch statement use trim and equalsignorecase in that order combined with if else of course
hence when user except hive try to connect using jdbc authentication fails
you will still be able to run your python codes they won t benefit from spark though since you won t be using the pyspark libraries objects the objects you will be manipulating are pyspark objects rdd dataframes datasets therefore you won t be able to mix operations just like you can t mix pandas with other things
that s the only reason you d be using a microsoft driver as far as i can tell that much is unclear you ve mentioned sql tools so far which isn t accessible over odbc
personally i would not recommend you get it from hadoop hadoop more accurately hdfs is not a replacement for ftp if you files are small enough to be stored fine within ftp there is little reason to extract them to hdfs because hdfs is optimized to handle rather large files
as you can see in the exception stack it is caused due to parsefrom called on base filter but should be called on derived type
since it does not find the parameter it throws and error
log4j isn t the problem since it s the java compiler throwing the error
this is what caused the problem
part1 is not a file but a relation when you use the load command in pig you are instructing to load the contents of the file into a relation you cannot use cat on a relation since the most common use of cat is to read the contents of files
incase of linerecordreader it looks something like this code and based on file extension it does apply codec
since you have installed pyspark with conda and as you say jupyter notebook runs fine presumably for the same anaconda distribution there are no further steps required you should be able to open a new notebook and import pyspark
it really depends on your data queries
your table doesn t have a date column to begin with so you re going to have to make a new one
there are 2 main reasons for having under replicated blocks 1
therefore if you create a large number of blocks it can take a while to catch up
most things that break tend to result in an error here or there so assuming you don t see any it is unlikely that this is the case
since you want to use the functions contained in the py file in a udf you have to deploy the files on the nodes using py files srcsamp py when running your application whether it is a notebook a pyspark shell or a spark submit as prem said col1 was never initiated in your script so calling samp col1 won t work
the key therefore is a longwritable and the value is text
your second mapper is no different than the first so the definition of both mappers needs to be extends mapper longwritable text also method names mapcount and reducecount means nothing to mapreduce
the method names must be map and reduce accordingly and you should add an override annotation to let the compiler know that method overwrote the mapper class
you therefore only need one class for both mapreduce stages
the variable firstlines is defined in the body of the for loop and its scope is therefore limited to this loop
to trigger the evaluation of the rdds and collect the result we need an addition call to the collect method for each of the rdd we have in our list
when we apply the operation in map to filenames we are not working with an rdd hence the file names are processed sequentially on the driver the process which hosts your spark session and not part of a parallelizable spark job
because this allows spark to parallelize and optimize the work we want to do
therefore instead of sequentially creating rdds for every file we create one rdd for all of them and we retrieve our first lines with a single collect
map output key word file name value count partitioned based on word only group partition again based on word only now in recuder you will have input like iterate over the key we have taken key as word only based on group compactor dog
at the absolute least you should partition these into random directory names based on hashes where each level has at most 1000 entries
so that oozie uses the home directory of the user which has triggred the oozie worklfow rather than using the yarn home directory
wordcount program expects a hdfs file directory as an input hence it is failing
because since the location of table was changed but the hive metastore was not updated with the new partitions in new location
it is a new data set containing columns from two or more sheets based on a key column which you defined
this should help to identify whether the problem is due one or more splits being assigned more than once or due to a bug in the code that processes a split
because the result of col1 null is undefined
this issue is caused by an incompatability with cdh 5 13 and vora 1 4 patch 4
since version 2 0 vora is deployed in a kubernetes cluster instead of the hadoop cluster
after much research and trial errors i was finally able to find a resolution for this issue thanks to aws support folks
it seems the issue is an occurrence as a result of s3 s eventual consistency
as i read you already found that file so you can move to next step
i was getting this issue because the keytab file was missing on one of the machine
even though i used as parquetfile flag this means nothing because hortonworks connector for teradata doesn t support parquet
when reducer phase is finished cleanup method simply writes a result of every processed partition single biggest kv pair in top5dataengineer map
the solution is either going to be to increase the heap size1 or change the way that you process the resultset so that you don t need to hold it all in memory at the same time
it fails when you call groupby because this the point where spark has to decided on the number of partitions and touch the input
thanks to cricket 007 s helpful comments and some more digging i was able to solve this
yes because if you plan on turning off the emr cluster and it bootstraps a separate machine on next boot then you ll lose the config
that user is being interpreted as a hostname in that path which is why the java net unknownhostexception thinks it s looking for a host called user
then spark will not be able to determine schema so you have an option to tell spark which schema to use upd in case if file has multirows formatted json you can try this code
that java lang arrayindexoutofboundsexception is usually due to your having the wrong number of fields in a record or vector
this can be caused by improper parsing wrong delimiter stray commas in a comma separated file etc
by default user have write access in tmp directory hence it is working
more output from the mapper code would be again you can see the letter o is having value as c 2 because it occurs twice in the sentence
then depending on how you wrote the values your reducer will see sum the ones and extract any one of the nines then divide
first i installed a syslog capability so that i could actually view the log messages
this is running on alpine linux so i did the following in my dockerfile so i d get messages once i did this in the var log auth log file i found i didn t set a password for the account since it wasn t going to be used interactively
if it has failed because one of the mapper threw an exception just clean up the output directory or fix the csv programatically and rerun
edit based on comments from op in this case you may use a counter in mapper to increase the count on the failure
trying to create another sparkcontext sc sparkcontext getorcreate results in errors
this is due to the fact that by design only a single sparkcontext can run in a given single jvm
based on the stacktrace i believe the error comes from the app hadoop staging directory path not existing or the permissions for it are not allowing your current user to run commands against that path suggestion hortonworks and cloudera offer pre built virtualbox images and lots of tutorial resources
most companies will have hadoop from one of those vendors so it s better to get familiar with that rather than mess around with having to install hadoop yourself from scratch in my opinion
so that you can perform i o operations with hdfs and submit jobs to yarn cluster
for me this spark submit run the python on all spark nodes the spark environment need to be extended with export pyspark python opt bin python furthermore the py file need to be located on hdfs so that all spark nodes in the cluster can read it
because your filepath doesn t start with a it s relative but dbutils is expecting an absolute filepath
i don t have enough reputation for making the comment so writing it here
if you re not doing any parallel processing there s not much reason to use hadoop other than to learn the api semantics
aside from an educational perspective in my career thus far i find more people writing spark than mapreduce and not many jobs asking specifically for mapreduce code
that s probably due to the fact you are copying a file that s being written to
add all the hbase library jars to hadoop classpath you can append any external jar needed to hadoop classpath so that you don t need to explicitly set it in spark submit command
see second step to creating a file you re missing a t and it s taking your file as a url which is malformed therefore the error
mayank while listing files in hdfs it is always suggested that you use eg hdfs dfs ls so see all the directories in the hdfs root and then descend accordingly
you have no user root folder so no directory can be made within it
if possible please attach the json file so that i can try end to end
it may caused by hosts file setting problem in this file etc hosts add your ip hostname at last line with vi command save exit then restart your network and reformat your hdfs with this command
the observed output is due to hive partitions being present for the future but data files have not yet been populated for them in hdfs
i used this to create a compression tool in hdfs when i was researching on approaches to this a lot of people were essentially reading the file to stdout and compressing it that way however when it came to doing a checksum on the original file and the file being compressed and decompressed the results were different
this was due to the type of data in these files and there was no easy way to implement bytes writeable
to improve performance you can increase the number of node managers so that the resources also get increased and moreover the job will be distributed on more number of nodes which will result into low latency
however time consumption will be more which is not an issue in your case
with a value of 1 you don t get any replica at all hence you ve lost some data
you can give hive access to an existing hbase table use create external table use hbase shell to verify data again query back to hive now you have data in hive external table so you can export it to csv file with separator
generally because people working with data in the hadoop hive spark space have those same preconceptions of what a filesystem does those ambiguities don t actually cause problems in production
you should use to store a shell variable though i haven t tested it since i don t have hadoop with me
possible solutions soution 1 since this is a local system under your full control change the permissions to allow everyone access
running 3 1 1 also from homebrew i m also using java 10 but i would suggest setting java home in hadoop env sh to be java 8 otherwise if i from the question replace users yishuihanxiao personal home ws db data with tmp so that my files are under tmp hadoop hdfs again from the question remove fs default name from hdfs site xml because it shouldn t be a property there individually run hdfs namenode format then start with hdfs namenode then the namenode starts
this bad bad connect ack with firstbadlink error means while processing query problem while getting required data for processing seems like the data nodes input data in consistent states try to check if there is any outage in your cluster due to which data node service is not running correctly
depending on the full context of what you are doing you could find that class in various hbase related packages
you can see them all here pick the version that is suitable to you and either downloaded or update your pom xml accordingly https mvnrepository com artifact org apache hbase hbase client if this specific jar doesn t suit you there are a few others where chis class could be found
there is only one disk under the line and the values of volfailurestolerated and volsconfigured are both 1 so it will cause the code to fail
for the most part i would say your code looks fine and the combiner is just an optimization so excluding it should produce the same output as including it
different column chunks can use different compressions therefore there is no single field for the compression codec but one for each column chunk instead
for negative results put a not before rlike
it has the following syntax second you can use regexp replace which has the following syntax test data will result in note a 0 which specifies the index produces a match after the extract based on the pattern
i would rewrite your query as replacing group all since i think you want the sum per bigram entry
replacing bg tmp2 with bg tmp since you want to reference the bg tmp bag inside bg tmp 2 relation
the end result of the first step is per day the total amount traded
that explains why you would be getting classnotfoundexception if you downloaded spark from the second link it includes a version of hadoop greater than 2 4 and those libraries are included on the spark classpath so you should not add them into your pom anyway
ok we faced the same issue on gcp and the reason for this is resource preemption
this error occurs randomly because some times the node that get preempted is your driver node that causes the app to fail all together
the following could be other possible causes the cluster uses preemptive workers they can be deleted at any time so their work is not completed and could cause inconsistent behaviors
there exist resizing in the nodes during the spark job execution that causes to restart tasks containers executors
disk space in the workers is full due to a big amount of shuffle operations or any other process that uses disk at the workers for example logs
this is an expected behavior from hive by executing above statement means you are creating test database on pointing to user hive directory so that s the reason why hive haven t created test directory
your third line could be simply if you wanted to use the alias name for some reason you should use the referential operator as can be seen in the error suggestion
then your line would look like next let s try to understand the exact reason behind the error message
since your alias had more than one row it complained
reproducing your example i am getting a java net sockettimeoutexception after 60 seconds caused by java net unknownhostexception unknown host hostname of my zk server
this error seems like the one explained in this article section zookeeper at the end this answer on so summarizes the solution
your hosts file should look like this remove lines with 127 0 1 1 and hard coded references to the hostname your dns server should know how to resolve hnode1 not have the pi point back at itself because then hdfs clients will get looped back to the pi when communicating to the namenode
according to the documentation the number of preemptible workers needs to be less than 50 of the total number of nodes within your cluster to have the best results
spark may use jdbc for impala to access kudu tables due to security aspects with kudu too coarse grain
therefore no loopback addresses should use your computers hostname for example remove the second line of this or remove the hostname from this most importantly emphasis added
i had similar issue and in my case it was because of data rollup as slim mentioned in his answer
therefore the recommended pattern would be to create a new file
and almost all hadoop processing engines can read entire directories so this should not be a problem
therefore you would want something like this which generates a timestamped file for every time your process runs
therefore don t waste too much of your time on it
try to use your original configuration file with the following modification in your conf file note that you have an extra s because according to flume documentation the correct property is only channel
note despite its name the secondary namenode does not act as a namenode and the state of the secondary namenode lags that of the primary therefore it ll never get data that didn t already arrive on the primary it will checkpoint what s already there
hadoop scripts require bash not sh though i would suggest starting hdfs and yarn separately so that you can isolate other issues you also need to downgrade hadoop to at least the latest 2 7 release for spark to work
this location is often based on the table and partition however the location can be completely arbitrary so you can utilize this to implement snapshot isolation or versioning
this bug was fixed in zeppelin 3701 missing first several 0 and losing digital accuracy in result table wait for release 0 8 1
in case if you re sure about the reason being the absense of inserted partition you may issue the following query prior to inserting your data
refer making files available for tasks and packaging files for job submission basically you only require the file name for the scripts not a path make sure the file is executable you can optionally rename the file using the marker as shown in the links but your local script name is the same as the reducer file so that s not necessary
nonetheless you can still take advantage of cloud storage to have data persistence reliability and performance because remember that data in hdfs is removed when a cluster is shut down
the reason is that apache ranger was layered on top
if that doesn t work it also supports java actions for running a jar so you could write your spark scripts all starting with a main method that loads up any configuration from there
first off hadoop core 1 2 1 jar was built way before hadoop 2 9 2 was even a thought so you re going to need a new jar not clear why you weren t using eclipse the whole time
best to literally say namenode data 1 2 3 yarn rm and so on regarding permissions issues you could run everything as root but that s insecure outside a homelab so you d want to run a few adduser commands for at least hduser as documented elsewhere but can be anything else and yarn then run commands as those users after chown r the data and log directories to be owned by these users and unix groups they belong to
it sounds like a contention but that is causing a conflict
basically the bucketing sink expects writes and renames to happen immediately like they would in a real file system but that isn t a good assumption for object stores like s3 so the bucketing sink ends up with race conditions that cause intermittent problems
i ve created only fqdn nn1 zim com this was the cause of the issue
this error message describes that a submitted job couldn t allocate the required cluster resources vcore memory before a timeout thus it failed to run likely more was requested than available in total so otherwise it could have waited forever
i assumed based on the content of your yarn site xml that the cluster was deployed on localhost
in that case you can check the available resources for spark on yarn jobs on the http localhost 8088 cluster scheduler page aka yarn resource manager interface
minidfscluster has some issues due to sharing of config and certain use cases can result in unexpected results and falsely failing or passing unit tests
if you want to use the fs defaultfs you should not specify any scheme or authority so yours paths should look like path to file
however in reality good performance is not a result of large files but large rowgroups instead up to the hdfs block size
short answer is because you change the name of the topic in your transformation
when sinktask that is responsible for processing messages is created in open method for each partition topicpartitionwriter is created
when it processed sinkrecords based on topic name and partition number it looks up for topicpartitionwriter and try to append record to its buffer
sinkrecords that are passed to hdfssinktask put collection sinkrecord records have partitions and topic already set so you don t have to apply any transformations
i ve also read around that increasing the open file count limit is needed for clusters too i set it up that way to avoid issues in the future
since you know the maximum relationships that can be in hierarchy below would be the query query above query is for level 3 you can replicate it to level 15
in scala in general you can use tuple3 zipped specifically in spark sql 2 4 you can use arrays zip function however you have to note that your data doesn t contain array string but plain strings hence spark arrays zip or explode are not allowed and you should parse your data first
thanks to the friends who are trying to help me
that s called side effects of an inconsistent filesystem with a job committer which depends on consistent directory listings to rename work into place fixes use a consistency layer for s3a that s s3guard use an alternate committer for asf spark and hadoop 3 1 that s the zero rename committer radical but best in long term use a different layout for data with apache iceberg being the one i have in mind update this is not true in this specific instance as ceph is the fs and it is consistent
since you are using windows path here you have to escape the or use slash also with put command you have to give only destination directory path
beeline connect to hive using the properties at kylin hive conf xml but for some reason probably due to the hive version included in hdp 2 6 some of the loaded hive properties cannot be set when the connection is stablished
the hive properties that causes the issue can be discarded for connecting to hive to query the classpath so to fix this issue edit kylin home conf kylin properties and set kylin source hive client beeline open the find hive dependency sh script go to line 34 aprox and modify the line hive env beeline shell hive conf properties beeline params outputformat dsv e set 2 1 grep env classpath just remove hive conf properties check hive depedencies have been configured by running the command find hive dependency sh
you can build accumulo with the hadoop 3 profile by downloading the source tarball and doing if you re not interested in rebuilding from source it may be possible to simply fix the class path issues by reading the error message and adjusting your class path accordingly
your file only has one column in spark s reader so therefore the dataframe output will only be that
you didn t necessarily do anything wrong but your input file is malformed if you expect there to be more than one column and if so you should be using spark csv instead of sc textfile because those types need a schema which rdd has none
it s because of data type conversion
you will have to create the primary key using the below command since these constraints are not validated an upstream system needs to ensure data integrity before it is loaded into hive
1 since there is ambiguity related the delimiter update the file to have a delimiter of that identifies actual fields
on the other hand it s an integer number so you can specify a big enough number which will work effectively as infinite
your code does not work because date1 is in the group by
this is wrong this is the id of my docker container because no host name is set
tests is called a classifier and it contains code that s really only useful in the context of actually testing such as an embedded hdfs system you could explicitly try pulling in a new version like so assuming it exists you may also want to exclude the same within the other dependency however you might then run into build issues since that library is only written to test against 2 8 3
because user hdfs has no permission to access one of the file s ancestry directories so it gave the error no such file or directory
partition value is required during insert operation since it is a partitioned table
the reason it s failing is that a shell action will run on an arbitrary node in your cluster and those nodes do not have spark submit installed on them hence the no such file or directory error
since you re using spark if hive table is already exist then it will not touch meta data info only updated data
and our validationcolumns are name and age where we shall count nulls we put them in a list scala val validationcolumns list name age and we create a sql string that will be driving this whole calculation scala val sqlstr select validationcolumns map x sum x count as x sum mkstring from select validationcolumns map x case when x then 1 else 0 end as x count mkstring from select validationcolumns map x nvl x as x mkstring from example table where validationcolumns map x x is null mkstring or layer1 layer2 it resolves to select sum name count as name sum sum age count as age sum from select case when name then 1 else 0 end as name count case when age then 1 else 0 end as age count from select nvl name as name nvl age as age from example table where name is null or age is null layer1 layer2 now we create a temporary view of our dataframe inputdf createorreplacetempview example table only thing left to do is execute the sql and creating a map which is done by validationcolumns zip spark sql sqlstr collect map toseq flatten tolist tomap and result map name 1 age 2 obviously you can make it type safe
hdfs allows for atomic creation so the second write will fail
for instance if comparing a string to an int then 1 00 1 true because the values are compared as numbers but as strings 1 00 1 false because the values are compared as strings you can get similar issues with dates i think
i prefer views because i can drop and recreate them without issues unlike tables whose drop will cause the underlying hbase table to vanish as well b this is not possible afaik
i if you create a phoenix table the hbase table will get created automatically and write to hbase directly you will have to take care of using phoenix types for writing so that they will be properly read from hbase https github com apache phoenix blob master phoenix core src main java org apache phoenix schema types
it can be set to derby on druid side but derby is like sqlite so it can t be accessed by hive
thus hive doesn t allow derby as a valid argument to hive druid metadata db type property
i am assuming you want to create a new column called standardnames based on corruptnames if the regex pattern is true otherwise do something else
note your pattern won t compile because you need to escape the second last with
i suspect the password file might be created with newline characters since password works fine and the only difference or change made is conversion to using a password file
when you try to run a hive query it will run the mr job the mr job will run exactly the same process for both 1 billion records and 10 records so it may be faster when you set some environmental variables mentioned in other answers but you cannot expect the speed of hbase or rdbms or other databases when dealing with small data
since it s a mapreduce way
it needs to wait before actually returning the results i e
need to commit the results first
if you need the same query results faster please note same query then cache the results for faster retrieval next time
or use the spark to fetch the results faster
also to make it more faster cache the query results
you can use hive s limit optimization properties to achieve desired results link you can also refer to these properties from hive docs
i set a securitymanager to the system to avoid system exit in org apache spark deploy sparksubmit main calls which will result in service exit
my sulotion work a charm in my app by default jvm doesn t use a securitymanager so if i don t invoke forbidsystemcall which attach a user defined securitymanager to jvm the problem did not occur
first secondary namenode actually means something and it seems like you meant standby namenode instead based on the error you get
the root in the resource manager is used only to group the queues in hierarchical form
you ve shown jps as running the history server so it s up
then you can access localhost 19888 from your host web browser regarding hdfs command you don t need to use any host and port if hdfs dfs ls shows you expected results the address is automatically taken from the fs defaultfs property also it seems like you put the vm on the host only network of the 192 168 1 x subnet
in your script result foreach u2 generate count u2 product is wrong
so i d to use pyspark instead gave me following result
in my example i have created an auto increment table i have this data in a file and the sqoop export the result
please take a look at yarn s capacity scheduler which allows you to schedule containers on nodes based on the available capacity
your problem is probably because you configured your brokers in the group parameter
based on the information provided here is what i suggest you do create spark session enablehivesupport is required next execute ddl for table resultant table via spark sql write data as per your use case notes working is going to be similar for spark shell and spark submit partitioning is can be defined in the ddl so do no use partitionby while writing the data frame
it is just because i didn t create internal directories and i should use this command before loop instruction
have you checked if you have any resource limitation in emr ec2 role lets say you have this permission so the table that you are accessing is on us east 1
remove collect set in the inner query because it already produces array upper collect set should receive scalars
also remove group by in the inner query because without collect set there is no aggregation any more
2 vals use temporarydf and without caching the recomputations will be as you see and they may well give different results
that s bad because if you try to initialise a json from this class path you will find 2 source
how big is the results data being sent to each user
how big is the database that has to be searched to generate that result
for responses the solution will depend on the data
to extract or convert string to json prepare schema as per data in that column
because they are two different software packages
then your spark jobs will start referring to your hadoop configurations and know based on what configuration to connect to hadoop
as you can see in the error the dependency chain includes at least org apache phoenix phoenix core jar 5 0 0 3 1 4 0 315 which is accessible at https repo hortonworks com content groups public org apache phoenix phoenix core and there is no version 3 1 4 0 315 listed there which will cause the build to fail without some other location where such packages exist which i am not aware of any outside of the new cloudera repo listed in the comments
according to hive documentation hive indexing is removed since version 3 0 https cwiki apache org confluence display hive languagemanual indexing languagemanualindexing indexingisremovedsince3 0
so create the executorservice with 10 threads as a starting point and instead of your do another improvement is since org apache hadoop fs filesystem implements closeable you should close it
so i would extract it into a variable inside your try update although the above code seems to be the right approach for the closeable objects by default filesystem get will return cached instances from the and thus things will break horribly when close will be called on them
the reason that yours does not work is that you have whitespace before the first element so you have to use trim
this is determined by the property spark sql parquet writelegacyformat
otherwise you can corrupt the namenode causing you to need to format to get back to a clean state
the sqoop server acts as a hadoop client therefore hadoop libraries yarn mapreduce and hdfs jar files and configuration files core site xml mapreduce site xml must be available on this node
on the other hand the below document is illegal because the configuration element is defined twice
in order to do that you can use the following command on your terminal as shown here which is gonna output one or a number of paths depends on how many java versions you have on your system like in the screenshot below you can choose one of the versions or just take the single one you have and copy the path of it
but i still have several problems pig can write results in different order
so it make result useless
have no idea how to add names of counters to the result file
it s because it can t find any file with the name project data txt on your current directory of your local filesystem
you plan on moving a file between directories inside the hdfs so instead of using the put parameter for moving we can simply use the mv parameter as we would in our local filesystem
tested it out on my own hdfs as follows create the source and destination directories in hdfs hadoop fs mkdir source dir dest dir create an empty for the sake of the test file under the source directory hadoop fs touch source dir test txt move the empty file to the destination directory hadoop fs mv source dir test txt dest dir test txt notice how the user username part of the path for the file and the destination directory is not needed because hdfs is by default on this directory where you are working
alright here is my answer based on a few assumptions
the final output is a text file containing the key and the file names separated by a comma based on the information in the reducer class s comments on the pre condition and post condition
but if you really want to write a text indexrecordwritable pair to your context there are two ways approach it with string as an argument based on your attempt passing a string when you indexrecordwritable class constructor is not designed to accept strings and with hashset as an argument based on the hashset initialised in indexrecordwritable class
since your constructor of indexrecordwritable class is not designed to accept string as an input you cannot pass a string
hence the error you are getting that you can t use string as an argument
passing a hashset as an argument since you want to make use of the hashset
notice the r local and r hadoop flags for running a job https mrjob readthedocs io en latest guides runners html running on your own hadoop cluster setup your hadoop home and hadoop conf dir xml files to point at the cluster you want to run the code against then using the r hadoop runner flag it ll find and run your code using the hadoop binary and hadoop streaming jar file can t see your input but this line would cause that error if there were less than three tabs on any line and you don t need parentheses left of the equals i suggest testing your code using the local inline runner first mrjob will build and submit that for you
it s just a problem include in the version of jdk i don t know maybe oracle delete some file from new version so it s work when i switch from jdk 1 8 0 101 to jdk 1 8 0 05
launched tasks include all tasks launched regardless of whether they later succeed fail due to exceptions or are killed due to admin interference or speculative execution killing the slower task after the faster task completes
this will depend on if you re using the local job runner mapred job tracker local or if you re running in pseudo distributed mode i e
most hash algorithms have a value space far greater than the number of sentences you re likely to be working with and thus the likelihood of a collision will still be extremely low
despite the answer that i ve already given you about what a proper hash function might be i would really suggest you just use the sentences themselves as the keys unless you have a specific reason why this is problematic
though you might want to avoid simple hash functions for example any half baked idea that you could think up quickly because they might not mix up the sentence data enough to avoid collisions in the first place one of the standard cryptographic hash functions would probably be quite suitable for example md5 sha 1 or sha 256
see for example johannes schindelin s explanation of why it s probably unnecessary to change git to use sha 256 hashes so that you can appreciate the reasoning behind this
since these records appear first then you will know to apply your transformation to all the records in that ip address group
then you can read from hdfs rule 1 and rule 2 for each record in the input relatively efficient because it will be sequential read from the local datanode
it will be very similar to the way how a join is done using mr c i would consider some other optimization techniques like building search trees or sorting since otherwise the problem looks computationally expensive and will took forever
you can try like the grails example notice i don t know if you mistype it but 25 is a string so that it can t be age 25 edit i don t know how this doesn t work but in case you want to find with multiple properties you should use createcriteria
based on your condition i think it s suitable to try dynamicfinderfilter with approriate import
this results in same program being run again and again
for ex mapr has it s own proprietary implementation of hadoop but they claim it s compatible with apache hadoop which is a bit vague because apache hadoop is evolving and there are no standards around hadoop api
cloudera has it s own version of hadoop cdh which is based on the apache hadoop
hadoop is evolving very fast so this might be a bit stale
of course when comparing hadoop academically you must first start looking at gfs since that is the origin of hadoop
because of the media attention hype hadoop is being used for every thing
hint caused by java lang classnotfoundexception
because the wordcount example is meant to launch a mapreduce job it s intended to be run with the following this will set up the classpath for you
i ran into a similar problem ioexception stream closed and the problem is caused by reading from a stale stream
after spending sometime with a debugger it looks like the problem is caused by a combination of spring s configurationfactorybean and apache hadoop s configuration objects
depending on the dimension of the array you re using you said multidimensional but it s not clear what the actual dimension is
the error is because the jar file being referred in the command home ila hadoop 0 20 1 examples jar in not present
maybe amend as follows based upon your relative path to the hadoop command although i see from the link you provided you are prompted to download the examples jar where did you download this file too
your shared library depends on other shared libraries and these shared libraries are not available on the standard library path at runtime
you ll need to ensure that all the so s your library depends on are also on the library path for each cluster node either a standard system path like lib or you ll need to amend the java library path system property to include a non standard directory or just push them using the distributedcache also as it add the local folder to the library path
depending on how you re executing your tests you may need to apply the umask to your bash profile and re apply it http www cyberciti biz tips understanding linux unix umask value usage html
you ll need to amend the generics signature to your mapper reduce too depending on where you re calculating the average and also amend your job configuration to use floatwritable as an output class type again depends on whether you re using the float as an output key or value
the reason is that the pvalues iterator re uses the bsonwritable instance and when it s value changes in the loop all references in bsonobjects arraylist are updated as well
you should instantiate a new bsonwritable variable in that first loop that equals the variable value deep copy
since you are already in hadoop bin folder
some of the old tutorials are based on older versions of hadoop api
make sure that you check your flags because chances are that your compiler is getting confused about the architecture
you could create a group called hadoop and user called hadoop in that group as shown below sudo addgroup hadoop sudo adduser ingroup hadoop hadoop sudo chown r hadoop hadoop app hadoop tmp here is a tutorial for thistutorial to setup hadoop cluster
fewer writes often means better performance so a larger buffer might improve performance
results are usually automatically written to benchmarks testdfsio
you should have probably seen a line like this at the end of job execution log while dealing with testdfsio it usually means that lzo or other compression is used so there s extra something appended to the filename
all deamons are started via this so this is the main point to change this if env is not working
if bash profile and bashrc are not getting called its probably because the shell is being called non interactively by your ssh calls which has nothing to do with centrify
that s because the bashrc is not sourced if the shell is called non interactively
this is is because the bashrc is sourced when an interactive login shell is invoked
centrify is only responsible for authentication access control and policy enforcement and does not impact the default behavior of openssh or your shells
what is probably happening here is your key value class depends on another class either not in the jar listed in libjars or is in a nested jar in the libs folder in the jar
in fsshell i d set breakpoints at the these places and check also the serialization deserialization process of your custom writable since a bug during the deserialization can cause such problems
this is entirely dependent on hardware
the only thing you need to be careful of is if you have a custom group comparator which will cause the previous key comparison in the record writer to fail
the signature looks as follows there you get a context object where you can call map and cleanup both have these context objects so you can get your configuration anytime
0 20 205 was just renamed to 1 0 so it is esentially the same release
one side effect is that code compiled against hadoop 1 0 cdh3 is not compatible with hadoop 2 0 cdh4 and vice versa
however source code is compatible and thus one just need to recompile code with target hadoop distribution
you could fix that implementing your own recordreader which you could model after the keyvaluelinerecordreder described here but extend from recordreader intwritable text instead and modify the code accordingly
also the class not found and statspublishing issue is because by default hive stats autogather is turned on
that is because mapper is not able to find logfactory which is part of common loggings jar
if not just mark it accordingly source folder
this makes building new variables based on existing ones somewhat impossible and explains my failure to build a udf to construct a path glob
if you are a pig developer requiring new variables to be built based on existing parameters you can either use another script to construct those variables and pass them as parameters to your pig script or you can explore where you need to use those new variables and build them in a separate construct based on your needs
this is because parameters in pig are strings and cannot be cast or converted to other types within the pig script except when used in mr tasks
thus when you run your queries and you have a sql where log data 17 10 2013 00 00 00 then you effictivelly query all the data that you have collected so far
csvloader doesn t implement the storefuncinterface which is required for anything you want to use to store your results to
the process you describe looks intrinsically very inefficient i can t see why the jaxp step is needed but perhaps there s a good reason for it
from the little experience i have with hadoop clusters if your query is faster than 30 40 seconds with a computer there is no use for a cluster because it will take about 30 seconds to set up the map reduce job structure
as far as i know hadoop is based on a shared nothing architecture and so your private set set variable won t get shared among different mappers
the correct format is this is due to the code surrounding the following lines in org apache hadoop streaming streamjob
because that s the file the recommenderintro is looking for
because it allows you to use code completion execute build etc
the recommenderintro code isn t a distributed implementation and thus can t run on large datasets
you can try running but since that directory belongs to the user hadoop you likely don t have permissions
since escaping the whitespace character doesn t work as a workaround you can create a parameter file then issue note i use pig 0 12
in this case it points to usr lib jvm java 6 sun bin java which causes the shell to fail when running the commands
the first param is the source so it should be the path to s3 and the path should be s3n and not s3 native s3 unless you ve written the data to s3 using s3 block file system
by default hadoop has its own internal logic that it performs on keys and depending on that it calls reducers
unless you know how exactly your keys will vary this logic wont be generic and based on variations you have to figure out the logic
i imagine the best way to do this since it will give a more even split would be
try using setintersect a datafu udf https github com linkedin datafu and size to get the number of elements in the result bag
building off your example given these documents and given this query then this code gives you what you want values for result here is a fully working example that you can paste into the datafu unit tests for setintersect located here if you have any other similar use cases i d love to hear them we are always looking to contribute more useful udfs to datafu
hadoop mapred system refers to the directories inside hdfs so you don t see it from terminal using ls i did see the hadoop job ugi in advanced list and succeed to connected to the vm following the instructions there
you can do a cartesian join with the result of the percentile and then filter all the smaller values
the 3rd party dependency isn t included in the job jar by default and hence the error message you are seeing
it looks based on the messages above that you are installing cloudera on a cluster
it is asking you for ssh access to your computer nodes so that it can go through them and install all the necessary packages so that you can have a working installation
it walks you through step by step and even shows you how to get the word count program running so that you can get a feel for what the logs look like and how to run programs
this may be more in line with something you want since you were attempting to install cloudera above and it teaches more about the hadoop infrastructure than the toot above
when you use hbase in pseudo or fully distributed mode it has got some dependencies on hadoop libraries like rpc version might get changed because of a change in protocol
because of these dependencies each version of hbase comes bundled with an instance of the hadoop jars under its lib directory
thanks to tariq s answer and i solved it
in more generic practical terms if you re having trouble locating a particular open socket and know the port number make sure pass netstat the n option so it stops trying to identify the protocol based on the port number and displays the whole list numerically
this problem mostly occurred because of time stamp in the elastic map reduce and your computer is not same
this is the reason i did not write this initially
but a lot of so experts are out there to decide this they can do it much better than me having said that i would like to share a few things with you based on my personal experience so that you proceed towards the correct path
reason being a web service is something which has much wider scope of applicability as compared to tools like hadoop hive hbase etc
so it seems that this is by design
i don t use elephant bird so i m not entirely sure that this is the problem
rlike uses java regular expressions so you can use to express starting with something
however since
so i would say you could determine which hadoop version you re booting based on the ami version determine what are the libraries used in that hadoop version either inspect the running ec2 instances or download the hadoop version from apache website compile you program again the right hadoop and exclude all hadoop and hadoops 3rd party jars when you bundle the fat jar
if you re not going to be providing multiple implementations for this udf depending on the types of the arguments there s no real need to implement getargtofuncmapping
yes it is because of using different protocol on master and slave machine
when the script executes hadoop version then it expects output like this instead some other output snug in probably because you modified some scripts in the hadoop
since i don t have enough reputation to add comment i will respond to your question assuming you have a hadoop cluster with at least 2 machines nodes
therefore changing the slave etc hosts file line 2 to 127 0 1 1 joseph home fixed the issue and my logs appear normally on the slave node
the issue in my case is that the disk of one node in the cluster is full so hadoop cannot write log file to local disk so a possible solution to this problem can be deleting some unused files on the local disk
there could be n number of reasons for this
it could exactly result in an exception of loading dll although the file is there
below are the details my create statement ddl was not having any default column name so my guess is that phoenix created the default column family as 0
the answer gets more complex if you are running mr2 yarn since it no longer schedules by slots but by container memory
in a way it would be better because you express your resource requirement in terms of memory which is good here
you would set mapreduce map memory mb as well to a size about 30 larger than your jvm heap size since this is the memory allowed to the whole process
you can t really approach this by controlling the number of mappers just because you have to hack around to even find out let alone control the number of mappers it will run
you need to set the paths of hadoop 1 2 1 core jar and all the other dependent jars correctly try this exactly while you are in the desktop hadoop directory valid in your case only solely based upon the inputs you provided in the comments
we may add some configuration so that hive can use different connection strategy
b update the version file so that the two namespace ids match
the bug report that leads to this issue is recorded at https issues apache org jira browse hdfs 107
results in 1 not 1 so will not give 1 apart from that i just tried to print an iterable and it just gave a reference so that is definitely your problem
what do you mean depending on the values
if you are using the reduce phase to end up with exactly 4 files by using a single reduce task then you can also achieve what you want by flipping the key and value in your map phase and forgetting about multipleoutputs altogether because you ll end up with only 3 working reduce tasks one for each of your int values
the reason for whatever i have mentioned above is that your use case requires more than just scalability provided by hadoop
last but not the least it all depends on your needs
we can just suggest you based on our experiences but a fair decision can be made only after testing a few tools and finding which one fits best into your requirements
the trend i saw is that many organizations are using that as a data warehouse for offline data mining and bi analysis purpose as a replacement for data warehosue based on relational databases
some initial performance benchmarking result of impala i found
whereas in cdh 4 2 1 the jdbc driver jar files were expected in usr lib sqoop2 since cdh 4 3 0 they are expected in var lib sqoop2 instead documentation
nohup is a posix command thus you either need to install cygwin or run some sort of different script cmd or bat file
any reason you aren t running hadoop on a linux vm
bash functions are passed as regular environment variables so that exporting works across processes the environment variables generated bash will contain multiple lines which is normally fine
since it doesn t handle multi line variables it destroys your functions
the number of map tasks started is dependent on the number of input files or rather the number of input splits it looks as though you are increasing the number of files to process and thereby inadvertently including files that cause the failure
the job tracker will assign a map task to only one of these three nodes so it only reads data from that node
an another hand if the sizes are too large but only a few files are needed to proceed it is not cool to just wrap step 2 directly in a mapper because the job won t be spread widely and evenly in this situation i guess the key value only can be file no
because each block is dependent on the output of the previous block you cannot encrypt or decrypt block n w o first encrypting or decrypting block n 1
before considering configuring it check this first i had a look at the code of edu stanford nlp sequences exactbestsequencefinder you should try that too here i don t know which version of stanford nlp you use and i am not familiar with it but it seems to do some operations based on the sequencemodel you put as input
maybe you should consider reorganising your 31gb dataset so that it has more and much smaller lines than now if that is possible for your job
it might be that one line is too big by mistake and the cause of the problem
i think you are getting this error because the hsql server is not started
because writes to the local disk and not to hdfs
thus you have to look for it in your local filesystem
nearly every serialization framework in existence requires that your beans have no arg constructors available so that the framework can instantiate something via reflection before having read all of its data off the wire and writable serialization is no different
the most obvious thing to try is to not keep the whole file in memory if possible so you can maybe process it in chunks and at any moment of time keep just one or a few chunks in memory and not the whole file
java has good mappedbytebuffer that let you load a certain section of a file into memory for faster access it has certain problems until java 7 caused unpredictable unmapping but as far as i know it has since been fixed
i feel you are not seeing any output because join is not leading to any match
you are creating a join on name from a abc xyz def klm location from b hawthorne artesia garnet vanness and if you see there are no matching strings in two data sets so leading to no join
in that case run hadoop with admin privileges
depending on your version of hadoop this is controlled by the variables and on yarn hadoop 2 these are set in mapred site xml
therefore if you are not actually doing any reducing this interface is irrelevant
often such bags are the result of grouping but this is not necessarily the case
instead of loading the whole bag at once pig will load pieces of it at a time keeping track of what it needs to produce the final result at the end
as a side note the purpose of accumulator is not to speed up computation though this would probably be the result for bags that do fit into memory but just barely due to garbage collection
it is to allow you to process bags that otherwise could not be processed at all due to memory constraints
problems job configuration conf setoutputkeyclass text class conf setoutputvalueclass intwritable class the output class in your case is which will result in type mismatch exception reduce i am not sure why you are using hdfs api to write your output to a file
this is probably done for reasons of locality to minimize network traffic
so that was why you had two idle nodes because 5 tasks can be distributed to only three nodes with two slots ceiling 5 2 0 3
your logs will be different based on what tasks are running on a particular node
last note in this particular case it seems you re getting different behavior from the tutorial you followed because you may be running on aws using elastic mapreduce
more details in this answer hadoop number of available map slots based on cluster size
it works when you run the main class because the hive jdbc jar is configured in the build path
because of the nature of the application i am working on mr jobs launched from a hive hook from thrift i had to edit the mapreduce job configuration to include the jars in the tmpjars setting
this is probably caused by incompatible protobuf message versions
being splittable on file boundaries doesn t really mean anything since a bz2 file doesn t have any concept of files
so the number of splits you can create will depend on the size of a compressed block
edit based on your comment a split boundary in hadoop can often times occur half way through a record whether or not the data is compressed
the second mapper then ignores the first partial record in it s split since it has already been read by the first mapper
depending on this information you have to choose the key values
the reducer will then have all data sets with equal week key in access and you can do whatever you want to do aggregate and write the results out
to calculate the difference of weeks you can for example use joda package static method weeks weeksbetween if the concrete value of the week key is not of special interest you can also use a composite key like year 100 week which is much simpler to evaluate and therefore is faster
if you really need the special week timeline think about using the simple key first just used for aggregations in map reduce and do the more expensive week timeline evaluations later after the reducer has generated its result with much less data
try without the comma or use str to mask the comma from sas sql processor there should be automatic disconnect at the proc sql boundary so you can save some typing
yes can use map reduce functionality on couchbase cluster you will need to add more nodes to increase throughput of the cluster horizontally scale so it will have more computing power to serve concurrent request from the clients and also maintain map reduce views
i think you may want to replace this line with job waitforcompletion true so there would be no output after i hit the end of wordcount
since even cdh 4 x was based on hadoop 2 x the distribution of mahout 0 7 included packaging changes that also managed to make it interoperate on hadoop 2
so the cdh distribution of each of these versions is already compatible with their matched releases of hadoop even where based on hadoop 2
cdh 5 0 0 is basically based on hadoop 2 3
we are currently using a cdh 5 0 x cluster but needed also some fixes and improvements of mahout 0 9 so we are packaging our jar assembly with mahout 0 9 of the cdh 5 1 snapshot release and simple execute it via hadoop jar command
hadoop is pretty good at cleanly splitting up the input into parallel chunks for processing by the mappers so unless you are doing some kind of arbitrary aggregation i see no reason to reduce at all
using this input format we can read two files of different formats and the result of both combined goes to reducer job
but in pig defining in the schema a field as cost int is defining it as the object java lang integer and that cannot be cast to a java lang long e g the following doesnt even compile in java and this causes a classcastexception
first of all add the c parameter to the command like this adding that parameter does not resolve the issue but if you don t include it you get another error because of log4j configuration file
the hadoop version has a very different api since it calculates all recommendations for all users and puts these in hdfs files
following ways are most really reason for your problem
based on the information provided this is how you d invoke the cm api jobtracker restart
if this doesn t help for some reason try explicit casting
use a severity of error so that you can confirm that you can find logged error messages
configuration properties which are unimportant or new may not be listed in that case these properties are supplied in the safety val sections
i get following result on running your first query academic press inequalities theory of majorization and its application
once again try to do set hive exec dynamic partition mode nonstrict sometimes in hive it happens even if you set this property it considers strict mode hence i suggest you to set this property once again
edit so after further testing it s not a problem with your code except for the deprecation but that isn t the cause
hence the check always returns true
depending on the size of your cluster you might be more likely than not to have to go to the network for most of the files that you are processing
you are processing them manually so it doesn t matter what format they are in since they are not being passed into map reduce
it s working now but could be for a variety of reasons
for posterity here s what i changed removed the empty done flag used dataout instead of datain added another dataout events giving each a unique name it would take some debugging to pin down the exact cause
in your case since the reducer gets as input and emits as output text change the definition from to
so if you want 70 of tasks result even if 30 fails you could do so with above properties
note that put zlib h directory in path is wrong and not necessary only zlib bin directory is needed as said in building guide https svn apache org viewvc hadoop common branches branch 2 building txt view markup also zlib h requires some header not present in windows so you will need to download those headers and put in the same folder with zlib h

if you have an imbalance due to some files being significantly larger than others you can try rebalancing your typeddata rdd by similarly invoking repartition on it although this will be much more expensive as it will shuffle all of your tsv data
alternatively if you rebalance filepaths and still have some partition imbalance caused by having a number of somewhat larger files that end up in a few partitions you might be able to get a bit better performance by using a larger number in the repartition argument such as multiplying by four so that you get four times as many partitions as there are cores
now i realize that since dse uses hadoop 1 0 4 an ancient version it works with jre 7 only
the reason being that the default bytecapacity is 80 of the processes max memory which is already consuming a lot process memory
so as found out there were several duplicated records and this was the cause why execution was stuck
there is no shell expansion of inside quotes so the command doesn t work
what about such approach or if you want to store the result to a variable do it like this
extending on this it is also possible to construct a parquet friendly schema no unions that is compatible with all your schemas so you can use just that one
this information is used deep within hadoop code to initialize mappers and input formats so that s where you should add your own code
by comparison a 64 bit program is limited to 128 tb to 256 tb depending on the os
the problem was the agents in different nodes couldn t execute the callback cause they couldn t reach ambari server url in that port
the problem is here in your code since you for loop is 1 based you left paths 0 null that is unassigned
you would then like to create a new column in gc 1 named month i don t recommend that by the way since month is also the name of the built in function and populate it with the calendar month of all corresponding values in the datestamp column
as an alternative there is a way to avoid storing a duplicate table this directly overwrites the original table so a second table is not created
in this case you have a single non aliased function call per select so they all create a column c1
the issue is that because you are doing a select from the next sub query down and then appending another function call that maps to c1 then you have the same column named twice and hence an error around an ambiguous column reference
the solution should be to alias all of your function calls so that they do not use the c1 default name like so
can you verify that the following environment variables are set your actual values may vary of course depending on where hive and hbase are installed
if you mention the jars after the two then you will for some insane reason keep getting the bsonfileinputformat exception
this error at org apache hadoop mapred yarnchild main yarnchild java 158 caused by java io ioexception exceeded max failed unique fetches bailing out
possible causes you have two network interfaces setup and you are routing through the wrong one
it s not a bag since it s not made up of tuples
try for some reason pig wraps the output of a line in curly braces which make it look like a bag but it s not
i haven t done any hadoop development so i don t know how many jar files are involved
for example since you have a path to home bin myapp jar you will either need to modify the script application launching the jvm to follow suite or ask about the specific application you are using ie jboss tomcat glassfish etc
the cause of the problem are incorrectly set env variables you explicitly set all these variables to hadoop home value what is wrong
this causes gg to compose incorrect hadoop classpath as seen from the below gg node log so to fix the issue please don t set unnecessary env variables
then i got this error not a valid jar users pig 0 14 0 pig 0 14 0 snapshot core h2 jar users pig 0 14 0 pig 0 14 0 core h2 jar to resolve it remove that jar file in that location
data is is in json format you have created table on the top of data so each time when you query the data it needs de serializer to interpret josn data into hive supported data format so before running the query add the jar as add jar usr lib hive lib hive serdes 1 0 snapshot jar this jar is having jsonserde class which deserialize the json object
the root cause may be lack of disk space in the hdfs cluster based on the fact that the query seems to fail only after running for a while and combined with this message from the stack trace that message seems to crop up when there is a network communication issue lost communication with data nodes for example or if hdfs is unable to service a write operation because no data nodes with free blocks could be located
since your query does successfully start to me that tends to rule out the network issue instead it appears that your hive query is running out of disk space trying to generate that table
each partition is a chunk of data stored in memory of a single jvm and the node to store them is chosen based on locality of the source data
in your specific case with textfile and setting up number of partitions this number would be pushed down to the hadoop textinputformat class that would implement reading the file in 10 splits based on the file size each split would be approximately 5 8gb so in fact after reading the source file into 10 partition i assume that you would execute cache and the action like count on top of it you would have 10 chunks of the data each one is 5 8gb stored in the heap of 3 jvm processes running as yarn containers on your cluster
the implementation is multi threaded so all cpu cores can be used during computation
the extent of this could mean that it could be faster to use a non hadoop implementation of the algorithm but this would depend on what processing resources you have available and the nature of the dataset
if that is true then the coalesce col name n a function would always return the value of col name because that is the first non null value listed in the function
also add path to the shell script in both shell command as well as files sometimes this may cause same problem
the first line of main you clearly intended data to be a dictionary so that comma should be a colon key values
mapper never uses its key parameter so you re effectively creating the idx value just to throw it away
still there s no reason to feed main s key to reducer just to get it back unchanged
i did this because a tutorial showed me the steps to connect to hive
they should instead use hdfs because hue user does not have rights to launch mr jobs which are required to run joins on hive
jobconf class is an extension of configuration class and thus you can set custom properties then as atated in the documentation for the mapper mapper implementations can access the jobconf for the job via the jobconfigurable configure jobconf and initialize themselves
with the new one it is easier to access the configuration since the context and thus the configuration is passed to the map method as an argument
it isn t doing anything i don t think hive allows column aliases in the group by so you need to put in the entire expression or use a subquery cte
hive does not parse double quote or single quote in that way
container size is not fixed it is dynamically allocated based on requirement by resource manager
therefore if the resourcemanager goes down because of some hardware failure then there is no way to avoid manually debugging the cluster and restarting the resourcemanager
during the time the resourcemanager is down the cluster is unavailable and once it gets restarted all jobs would need a restart so the half completed jobs lose any data and need to be restarted again
one way is by creating an active passive resourcemanager architecture so that when one goes down another becomes active and takes responsibility for the cluster
another way is by using the zookeeper resourcemanager quorum so that the resourcemanager state is stored externally over the zookeeper and one resourcemanager is in an active state and one or more resourcemanagers are in passive mode waiting for something to happen that brings them to an active state
it is the responsibility of the new applicationmaster to recover the state of the older applicationmaster and this is possible only when applicationmasters persist their states in the external location so that it can be used for future reference
applicatoinmaster will store their state to persisitant disk thus all the status till the failure can be recovered
ams are then responsible for reacting to node failures by redoing the work done by any containers running on that node during the fault
i am not sure what the cause of the problem could be but you might want to change the ami and launch emr with a different ami version 3 0 for example
what might be happening in your environment is when you increase values of the mapreduce map reduce memory mb and mapreduce map reduce java opts configurations to upper bound it actually reduces the number of containers allowed to execute map reduce task in every node thus eventually causes the slowness in the over all job time
if you have 2 nodes each with 25 gb of free ram and say you configured the mapreduce map reduce memory mb as 4 gb then you might get atleast 6 containers on every node totally it is 12 so you would get a chance of running 12 mapper reducer tasks in parallel
so the mapper reducer tasks would mostly run in sequence due to lack of free containers thus causes a delay in the over all job completion time
you can allocate memory for map reduce containers based on two factors available memory per each datanode total number of cores vcores you have
including hyper threading for example if you have 10 physical core 20 cores including hyper threading so total number containers you can plan is 19 leaving 1 core for other processes assume that you have x gb ram in each data node then leave some memory assume y gb for other processes heap like datanode node manager region server etc now memory available for yarn is x y z memory for map container y number of containers per node memory for reduce container y 2 number of containers per node
this is because of the following reason
which give you change the basiccomputation signature in the program accordingly
i guess because i ve seen a similar error in data node logs before that you ve deleted your datanode data directory and restarted it
may be because of this hadoop was not able to access these directories
hdinsight is using templton which doesn t have support for libjars so you can t use that templton docs also i m assuming you are building a custom hdinsight cluster using a powershell script
based on your sample cvs data your regex is not matching the trailing comma and it is also not matching the optional space character as shown in the first sample line of cvs data
so the first part you need to provide after the in the hdfs data txt is the hostname so it would be hdfs active master 9000 data txt in case it is useful in the future the default port with the spark ec2 scripts for the persistent hdfs is 9010
see this for example this is actually for word count you can probably build on this to find max value based on what you want to do
you should be able to group and get the max like this and compare results with combination of order limit
in your case it looks like the yarn resourcemanager may be unhealthy for unknown reasons you can try to fix yarn with the following however it looks like you re using the click to deploy solution click to deploy s spark hadoop 2 deployment actually doesn t support spark on yarn at the moment due to some bugs and lack of memory configs
so the jar hadoop core thats where cansetdropbehind is present is not added properly in your eclipse from local repository for some reasons
when you run the jar from terminal the reason for running can be due to the presence of jar in the classpath referenced
then the reference would be picked from inside your jar without depending on the class path
verify each step and it will help you identify the cause
found that this was caused because the hadoop common jar for the version 0 23 11 did not have the class changed the version to 2 7 0 and also added below dependency got rid of the error then but still seeing the below error exception in thread main java io eofexception end of file exception between local host is mbr xxxx local 127 0 0 1 destination host is localhost 54310 java io eofexception for more details see http wiki apache org hadoop eofexception

hope this helps again it depends on the eclipse version you re using
our problem s root cause is that we downloaded apache spark from official site and builded it
finally we have learned today spark cloudera distribution is available in github https github com cloudera spark tree cdh5 1 2 0 5 3 2 and after building it we have saved the job result to hdfs
as your note mentions the application works correctly when the results are printed in the console but gives errors whenever you try to save them in the underlying hdfs
if i am not mistaken this implies that when outputing the results into the console spark might not be using the underlying hadoop infrastructure
when saving the results in the hdfs spark does use the underlying hadoop infrastructure
map job is occuring in your last query so it s not that map reduce is not happening
the likely culprit here is that for some reason it is not finding a match on the value idc
try this to see if you get any results or these will grab any row that has a value containing the string idc
i found the reason for it
because in one of my reducers it run out of the memory
because in one of my reducers it run out of the memory so it throws out an out of memory exception implicitly
and maybe another thread of reducer want to output so it creates another multiple output object so the collision happens
set the following in your tez site xml the current staging directory seems to be configured to use clustername tmp staging which ends up using the same path for multiple users causing permission conflicts
unfortunately since the various paths library dependencies and daemon processes are fairly different between hadoop 1 and hadoop 2 there s no easy way to upgrade in place right now
you don t need to specific a location because your query is creating an internal table see answer 2 below which is created at a default location
external tables need to specify a location in azure blob storage outside of the cluster so that the data in the table is not deleted when the cluster is dropped
use internal tables when you want hive to manage the data and storage short term usage like a temp table creating table based on existing table as select does the container user hive warehouse salesorderdetail exist in your blob storage
solution is to close the current hive cli session open another hive session and deploying jar for the new changes in initialize to take effect
for changes to take effect in initialize method restart a new hive cli session and redeploy jar process method redeploying jar within the same session works
since the information about number of columns is present in initialize method it was not working for any number of redeploys within the same session
as far as i can tell it s caused by the fact that multipleoutputs holds more data in memory longer
just remember to cast the values to double because your urlpath count is a long so you won t get any decimals if you don t cast it
since you re grouping by p key that would limit the number of reducers doing useful work
i believe you should be using t for the tab literal in split instead of t since that will attempt to split on the actual string t
hence parts length 0 doesn t sufficiently guard you against an out of bounds exception
as you can see in your case just because the length is greater than zero doesn t mean that there is an element at parts 1 you should be checking if the length is greater than 1
the where clause of the query should be treated as filtering criteria so it should not have any impact over the performance

for your problem 1 use customer partitioner and decide which reducer should be used to process a specific key currentdoc type 2 combiner will combine the data with in a mapper 3 outfrom mapper will be redirected a specific reducer depending on key partition shuffling 4 reducer will combine data for key received from respective mappers working code of partitioner combiner
instead of using jobclient runjob i would do the equivalent of what runjob is doing in your code so that when it fails you get a useful error message
as noted in that document you link to the latest version of ambari we support is 2 0 1
we are planning on updating the sprig xd install script so it works with more recent versions but we don t have a date yet
the issue that i missed earlier is that when i was getting the error on the name node it was not due to the contents of the job properties file
get the join result n a foreach loop and sum up the view values this will work
your myfunc has no return type so you can t call collect
i am now using the below function which does the job however landed up with another error the details of which i have posted here issue in accessing hdfs file inside spark map function
i think the problem is that textinputformat extends fileinputformat longwritable text so the mapper is not reading in the right format
i assume once this is solved and if your data is one to one you can map accordingly
the issue is because you haven t mentioned the precision
as others have noted you are getting the error because the output directory already exists most likely because you have tried executing this job before
since you only have one datanode hdfs is unable to satisfy your request
hadoop only keeps one copy on each node so a replication factor greater than 1 is not possible with a single node
using the optional option w could take lot of time because you re saying to wait for the replication to complete
it depends on the size of the file you re setting the replication factor when var 1 it just has to delete the remaining replicas on different nodes assuming yours is a multi node cluster when var value is greater than the existing value it will take lot time because namenode will have to look for which datanode is free and ready to accept the replicas and have to copy the file
if the cluster is busy running any other copy operation this also could cause delay to check if the replication is completed
anyway your webapp should have access to the following list of jar files i m not naming the jar version maybe some of them are surplus i am trying to cut down the list from a project that runs a map reduce job and then gets the results hadoop common guava commons logging commons cli log4j commons lang commons configuration hadoop auth slf4j log4j slf4j api hadoop hdfs protobuf java htrace core they are located across many directories in your hadoop distribution make sure your networking configuration is fine
it s because println a returns nothing unit whereas reduce is actually expecting a string to be returned
since you are using csv format with as the string terminator you most likely have an extra in your data which terminates a field incorrectly
found the reason
else it will produce wrong results
try to create a scan object without using spark configured to retrieve the same column from hbase see if the error repeats in addition by default tableinputformat is configured to request a very small chunk of data from the hbase server which is bad and causes a large overhead
here is a lil demo this gives you output like depending on what you have in the hdfs dir note the lib commands doesn t work with python 3 to my knowledge i m using python 2 7
i find this discussion useful in that sense subprocess popen to run commands hdfs hadoop i hope this suggestion helps you
the result will be written to data output part 00000 as csv
check what the name of your docker network is with a docket network ls inspect that network to verify your services are there with a docker network inspect name of your network the name of the network should be the name of the directory in which the docker compose file lives since you re using version 2
you don t appear to have any data cleansing so i think it s fair that it would produce dirty output like that
autowired won t work here because you are using a new instance of class mainapp which is not managed by spring and that s why you are getting a nullpointerexception a work around would be
check your hbase site xml it must be on your classpath because hbaseconfiguration create load config from path which you set on classpath and try to add it to the beginning of classpath to prevent loading of hbase site xml from other jar in which similar config file was embedded also it seems that you use hbase site xml from hbase server all config keys except hbase zookeeper quorum is redundant and useless in client
your array size is probably 1 so you re going past the last index since you re running it like this your args will just have 1 element the input path which is at index 0
if the datanode fails the other datanode having the same block because of replication is given the task
that is the cause of your error
in that case in finally block we can use deleteonexit so that jvm will mark and delete the filesystem once its terminated
for export using polybase please ensure that the specified path is a directory which exists or can be created and that files can be created in that directory
in my case i was storing one hashmap in hbase column i retrieved it back in my mapper method as hashmap as it is and was successful in that
since you wanted hdfs as datastore
you don t have to care about kinit because in fact it s too late for that
2 the oozie service user has special privileges it can do a kind of hadoop sudo so that it connects to yarn as oozie but yarn creates the delegation token for the job submitter i e
with ha high availability cluster if you are setting up ha cluster then you may not need to use secondary namenode because standby namenode keep its state synchronized with the active namenode
this part didn t change much since hadoop 1 x
your question since you are executing this program in cluster all the cluster properties will be taken care from inside the cluster since you are in cluster and you are executing hbase java client program now try like below execute same program in different way from remote machine eclipse on windows to find out difference of what you have done earlier and now
since it s a bash script you can add logic that checks the exit code of your last executed command
i have read some posts about impala queries erroring out but still giving a code exit code so you may need to mess with it
the example below would loop until the impala statement ran successfully so some sort of retry count logic may need to be added example with run count logic to exit after 2 attempts
it will need changing anyway your job won t work as you have it since sum count doesnt implement the writable interface
if you built the hive nar from nifi master 1 0 0 branch it is compiling it for java 1 8 which probably won t work with hdf 1 2 0 1 because that was compiled for java 1 7
you could checkout the 0 x branch of nifi and build the hive processors from there because that is still java 1 7 or you can get the latest 0 7 0 nifi release which already has the hive nar and just take the nar from the lib directory https nifi apache org download html
you probably need to include the package that class is in so you have the full classpath ie class package wordcount
it was caused by some invalid whitespace characters that somehow got into my xml a stray copy paste most likely
exceptions like nosuchmethodexeception are thrown because the methods or signatures of the methods you are using have changed from 1 5 0 to 2 0 0 and therefore the cluster does not understand them
it should give you couple of in performance depending on rows count difference
i think you need to rewrite the qualify row number over operation as select row number over where rownum operation in your inner query since hive is not yet supporting the usage of qualify rest all query looks fine from hive point of view including case
here is the altered query you can try with note i have validated this query in my environment i got the synamtic excpetion due to table not found and did not get any syntax errors
if you look at yarn resourcemanager logs will know the reason
boto3 module was not installed install it from console but the steps do not work because they would have to install it in all instances

below observations are based on sqoop 1 4 6 you are using
when kylin reports no counter for job usually it was because that mr job is failed or the hadoop history server wasn t started
if the mr got error you need look into the hadoop job logs to see what s the root cause could you double check and paste the error trace
stick to a very low number of columnfamilies 1 or 2 a column family maps to files in the underlying system and thus impose a load on hbase
and supply the closed source program2 with the virtual file name dev stdin as follows this is assuming you are working on linux you did not specify but i assume so because you are talking about fuse
a table in hive must have a defined schema which can t change depending on input maybe you can split your input file into two files record type dt and record type dd then load each of them into a different table
as a partial answer we found that in the worker nodes the gc was causing lots of long pauses 3 5 secs every six hours the predefined gc span
what is causing the heap going constantly full is still an open question but is beyond the scope of this
sqoop can t copy metadata or create table in rdbms on the basis of hive table
mapping from rdbms to hive is easy because hive have only few datatypes 10 15
looks like the sqoop sh script loads all of the jars from the classpath based on the environment variables set
if you append the following to your external table definition after the encoding clause it should help to resolve the issue where a small number of rows fail due to this issue here is a reference on this syntax http gpdb docs pivotal io 4320 ref guide sql commands create external table html
we think but have not confirmed that hdfs debug recoverlease path foo bar openfile fubar will cause the file to be closed which is far simpler

i will post my configuration below in case anyone else runs into this issue in the future
it was caused by a misconfiguration the orc compress size tableproperty is set by default to orc compress size 262144 which is 256kbytes but io file buffer size in core site xml is set to 131072 whis is 128kbytes
the tmp directory is formatted in linux on reboot by some systems so it must be the problem
my gues is that you need to specify different datadirs property for each channel cause both of them use the default value
i think quotes are causing problem two ways to handle them here 1 use piggybank to handle quotes rest your quote should work
here are steps to build sasl on windows but your mileage may vary a lot of this depends on your particular system s paths and available libraries
while using pyhive no authentication can be passed as auth nosasl instead of none so your code should look like this
once the map task is done for a job then the output is saved and then is transferred to partitioner class this class is responsible for separating data according to the reducers
for example in your case you have 3 machines you are running 2 reducers then getpartition method of partitioner class is responsible for dividing the map output for that 2 reducer ex hello 1 reducer 1 word 1 reducer 2 data 1 reducer 1 so now 2 separated files will be created one for each reducer no of these files created on each mapper node depends on whether the map output contains data for each reducer or not and remember till now all these files still are on mapper node
after this writablecomapartor class is called which is responsible for sorting the data in each of 2 files and it is also responsible for grouping them
after this shuffling and sorting is occur in which all the map node send the resultant output files on respective reducer node then on the reducer the files received from all the mapper is merged and sort ex so it there are 2 mapper and 2 reducers and one mapper generate a data for both reducer 1 and reducer 2 other generated only one output file which is for reducer 1 then reducer 1 will get two files and reducer 2 will get 1 file
your parameters are passed into the input tuple so you get the size and character from that
if this error is triggered at run time then it might be due to runtime class loading or excessive creation of string constants in permanent generation
nutch is based on mapreduce regardless of how it runs
see nutch script ps if you use nutch on a single machine it makes sense to run it in pseudo distributed mode so that you get the mapreduce ui to monitor the crawl parallelism etc
you can fix this by removing the last three lines pasted here as the documentation states these three properties will get spark locality wait s value by default so if you just omit them from your configuration you should get the desired result
you can see this doc in your situation if you have a table name example if you want to get the result of try this sql there are only one problem your id must be unique
in that case it will return two rows for that team
the select clause will be converted to a plan to the mappers and the output will be distributed to the reducers based on the value of year pairs
gobblin appears to depend on commons cli 1 3 1 and hadoop 2 7 3 is on 1 2
however in general it isn t a great practice to try and use the comparefilter this way since it is performing lexical comparison on the bytes not a logical integer comparison
this i assume caused an incorrect checkandmutaterequest to be sent silently and the check in checkandput to always pass
the reason behind http error 404 problem accessing dfshealth jsp
reason not found error is because namenode web ui is trying to access dfshealth jsp page which has been removed in the latest hadoop releases
this can be done in pig itself generate another column say f11 based on even rows in your dataset and subtract 1 from it to create sets of 2 rows with same id this will allow you to group those two records on the new column and sum the final column then join the new set with the relation and get the desired columns
output a b add a new second column based on even row number 1
finally able to connect hive through spring application this type of exception which i have asked we got due to compatibility issue with jars i e some version are not compatible to used with spring below i am attaching my pom xml for more clarification

kafka mysql connector is a plugin that allows you to easily replicate mysql changes to apache kafka and from kafka you can load to hdfs or hive for a mysql kafka solution based on kafka connect check out the excellent debezium project
there is a separate spring data hadoop config with the description spring for apache hadoop annotation configuration so that s probably where annotations would be
i believe you would get better results if you change that to say 8g memoryoverhead and 14gb executor memory
especially groupby operations will frequently cause serious data skews
rdds has very low performance with groupby see for instance this blog post for reason why so if you are on rdds you should use reducebykey instead
you can do that like this you haven t specified the data structure of these entities but it looks like you are looking for some max value and in effect throwing away unwanted data
the issue is most likely because of the load statement since you are not specifying the schema the datatype by default will be bytearray

but one obvious mistake is that at the beginning of sortmap there is the line which creates a map that does not maintain any specific order so filling it in sorted order has no effect
note that this is independent to the map created by the caller here the reference to the created map gets overwritten by the result of sortmap and thus the map instance entirely obsolete
but since all you are going to do is iterating once over the sorted map to perform one action you don t need to copy the sorted list to a result map at all as you could perform the action already by iterating over the list this uses java 8 s map entry comparingbyvalue comparator reverseorder builtin comparators

this error is because tez containers are not allocating enough memory to run the query
it is more common to be importing incremental changes since the last time data was updated and then merging it in the following example check column is used to fetch records newer than last import date which is the date of the last incremental data update second part of your question query is also a very useful argument you can leverage in swoop import that will give you the flexibility of basic joins on the rdbms table and flexibility to play with the date and time formats
for small files copyfromlocalfile is sufficient for large files it s more efficient to use apache commons io keep in mind that the local file name should not include the protocol so no file in there

since gcs doesn t have the same notions of chunks or blocks there s no way for it to have any similar definition of a filechecksum
that said there s a neat trick that can be done to define a nice standardized representation of a composite crc for hdfs files that is mostly in place compatible with existing hdfs deployments i ve filed hdfs 13056 with a proof of concept to try to get this added upstream after which it should be possible to make it work out of the box against gcs since gcs also supports file level crc32c
for future readers from here a datanode is considered stale when in the namenode ui datanodes tab a stale datanode will stand out due to having a larger value for the last contact among live datanodes also available in jmx output
keep in mind version 2 6 0 was released in 2014 so you might want to upgrade your cluster to at least a 2 7 x version also if running that on the cluster as a jar file you d want to add scope provided scope if you insist on using the jar files then you need the hadoop client 2 6 0 jar
the command looks absolutely fine to inspect the snappy file but it seems that some required jar file are not there which is causing classnotfoundexception
based on kite sdk documentation jsonfilereader parquetwriter and avroparquetwriter use hadoop libraries to work
also you have sent no key so it is not clear why you have set the value serializer to be the avro one
the start all sh scripts will not work since those only apply to the hadoop servers name node data node resource manager node manager but not all the services in the ecosystem like hive impala spark oozie hue
note that since i partitioned on street each street now has its own directory
if it s in the root you want foo py to clarify loading from hdfs then three slashes are needed hdfs foo py because the full syntax is hdfs namenode port fileuri using foo py implies the root of the hdfs user folder for the user running the command
apparently there would be much free memory so that your job can consume required
this alternative can be adopted when nodes are less in dev environment and you are sure that there will be no memory issues in production
just cast and check if result is null
specifically the cause of failure is but honestly just switch to ml pipeline
the other option is to insert the data into a database and then use executesql to issue a sql query that joins them together and writes the result out to a single flow file
mergecontent is meant to merge like data together so if all the data was csvs with the same columns and you multiple flow files with that data then you could merge them all into one big csv
hence for this job to work in yarn cluster mode i believe you need to place the local file in all the spark nodes in the cluster
in local mode worked fine because spark runs under yxs7634 user
ps special thanks to steve loughran
echo command result also use explain extended query it will print detailed query plan with predicates and fail if it is syntax error
otherwise your memory is probably swapping and causing it to be unresponsive
if the goal is to just get an integer value you would need to call a get on the writable and then the jvm handles serialization of the integer object rather than not knowing how to process a intwritable because it doesn t implement the serializable interface string does implement serializable
the hadoop fs ls works because it doesn t involve yarn
there are multiple reasons why this could happen
or it can be made available in the sqoop lib folder so sqoop will take it automatically alternately you can first check if your sqoop command is running correctly or not in cluster machine
thanks to leftjoin my problem is now resolved
it helps if your scala program embeds a unique prefix in each logging directive so you can filter your program logs from others
since hive does not support recursive cte query
below are results from res and hier temp table for the given test data
results after loop1 for queries mentioned in step 2 and 3 results after loop2 for queries mentioned in step 2 and 3 results loop3 for queries mentioned in step 2 and 3 this will get you the desired results but you might have to consider time taken for execution
for the consumer of the final table is this option much better as the table constantly exists so the queries are not invalidated with the rename
you also might need to load shared libraries directly it depends on the way you start your spark application
the error says so you can try either decrease source batch size or increase channel capacity to match source batch size
it seems it is combiner which causes your code fails
now imagine this scenario your mapper process this line and write following output to context now combiner come into play and process the output of your mapper before reducer and produce this now above line go to reducer and it fails because in your code your assumption is the value is something like this val1 val2 if you want to your code work just remove combiner or change your logic

as you have mentioned apache nifi doesn t have processors for azure files right now so follow the microsoft guide which you have quoted here and mount azure files to your linux machine and create the flow like this listfile fetchfile putgcsobject getfile or any get processors were of legacy nature and the new list fetch pattern is quite good as it helps you with state tracking etc btw you don t need putfile since the objective of that processor is to write file s into local filesystem but we are here dealing with gcs as our sink
the error is due to a bug in storm hdfs
a python 3 fork has been created since then snakebite py3
you can check the hdfs directory path in hive default xml and or hive site xml configuration file or in hive terminal using below command as mentioned hive uses hadoop so hadoop must be installed and running status hadoop home environment variable must be set export hadoop home hadoop install dir export path path hadoop home bin directories in hdfs file system must be created and given access to hive hadoop fs mkdir p tmp hadoop fs mkdir p user hive warehouse hadoop fs chmod g w tmp hadoop fs chmod g w user hive warehouse to list directories in hdfs file system hive wiki page
this folder is already present in hdfs so you are getting file exists error while running mkdir command
2 containers usually fits in just one node so adding more nodes doesn t give you more speed
emr sets up the defaults that depend on ec2 instance type and whether hbase is installed or not
the memory of spark on emr is allocated by yarn because the emr is not only for the yarn applications but it can have a lot of other applications which are not using yarn
the effect is also noted by aws

you can import like this if the class name will be same for resolving linkageerror so we have 2 classes with same name but in different package first class and second class and the main class
the following was giving me an error so the solution was so simple as adding a cache when reading the file
i am sure you dont want to delete all thus you can select the top n files that needs to be deleted lets say 100 then you can update your command to or if you know specific timestamp of your new files then you can try below command then read that file and delete all files one by one so you complete script can be like
anyway leaving this up so that anyone googling for this error message knows to go triple check their hadoop properties file
since you can run this example in hadoop it s the same way to run an application
the reason was the undocumented mapred fairscheduler locality delay parameter
because of this they were incurring large delays due to the fair scheduler s delay scheduling algorithm described here
however mahout s build system references hadoop so it will automatically download dependencies like hadoop
refer https github com yahoo oozie wiki oozie wf use cases mr api for some reason that could not catch my eyes since i was using the modified version of non api workflow
here i think the question is your tasktracker wants to ask the map output from master so it should be but in your tasknode it tried to get it from so the problem occurs and the main problem is not hadoop tmp dir mapred system dir and mapred local dir i m facing this problem too and i resolved the problem by deleting the 127 0 0 1 localhost in etc hosts of master maybe you can try it
edit in summary go to the etc hosts file in the file structure of the node that s causing the error and remove the line 127 0 0 1 localhost
although two warn but also affect the operating efficiency they still try to resolve the cause of the error is unable to find a job in the middle of the output file
since you re using maven i highly recommend baking your dependencies statically into your jar
the reason this occurs is your mapper and reducer jres have no pre existing context of your client s class path
setting the classpath on shared unowned boxes may be a big issue since the jar files have to be replicated to all the task servers
it s not because of maven thing
because hadoop was trying to copy the jar to different task jvms
in that case i would go with the all urls in one file approach
it is better to have larger files so that each mapper has enough work to do
this will also allow more data to be stored in hdfs because each file takes up ram on the namenode to hold metadata and ram is limited so if you use less number of files you can put in more data into the cluster and your namenode will be using up less ram
it depends on the error
on an error i increment a counter whose name is derived from the exception class name
but it looks like you may be able to use cdh3 based on the following stated in this blog post by cloudera the cdh3 distribution incorporated the 0 20 2 apache hadoop release plus the features of the 0 20 append and 0 20 security branches that collectively are now known as 1 0 the apache hadoop in cdh3 has been the equivalent of the recently announced apache hadoop 1 0 for approximately a year now
to be honest i have no idea what your code is trying to do but that s probably because i d do it in a different way and not familiar with the api s you re using
you can tell which input file and therefore the data format for the record by looking to see whether the value starts with a 1 or a 2
this limits you to have to take the whole result set and doing nothing else with the database connection in the meanwhile
i don t know what query exactly you have used because you have not given it here but i suppose you re specifying the limit and offset
yes there is some waste in that all of the values for each key are still sorted and copied to reducers but i don t really see a way around that
you could do a similar thing in a combiner and have it only output up to x for each key but depending on your distribution of keys mappers that s only a little bit helpful
as you want to have a single file as the result you could configure your mapreduce job using jobconf setnumreducetasks 1 to use a single reduce task only see jobconf javadoc for more information
the following command has the same result as shown above bin hadoop jar hadoop examples 1 0 4 jar wordcount license txt output for your information the main class is already defined in the meta inf manifest mf file contained in the jar main class org apache hadoop examples exampledriver
it s certainly case sensitive since it s trying to load the class wordcount or wordcount from the jar depending on the casing
since java is case sensitive in this regard so too is hadoop jar
i believe this is at least partly due to what chris white wrote here i guess if it still does not work there is another problem somewhere but that doesn t mean that chris white s point is not correct
but fields such as open and divs you do not because there is no ambiguity
these message also inform the jobtracker of the number of available slots so the jobtracker can stay up to date with where in the cluster work can be delegated
depending on when your mapper fails the cleanup may be called or not
so you need to make sure that running your mappers or reducers several times is always outputing the same result or it will be hard to debug
reason is that uuid bindata are part of mongo and widely used
that is because uuid is not built in type in pig
according to the documentation of the getinstance method it actually copies the passed configuration object thus any modifications you make to the configuration after you create the job will not be visible to any part of the system
this means that below your base directory you would have created when uploading the package structure my mega cool pack resulting in the complete file path home you mymegacooljavaprogram my mega cool pack and the class would be located here home you mymegacooljavaprogram my mega cool pack mymegacoolclass class this means you have to cd to home you mymegacooljavaprogram and run java my super cool package mymegacoolclass
the cause and solution is well documented on the website you did your tutorial on so i won t bother describing it here
shouldn t cause any problems just don t get them mixed up
so it turns out that you get named queues when you opt for a scheduler that uses them
this took a lot of research because in the first version of hadoop the fairscheduler used pools not queues and only the capacityscheduler used queues
just express your data processing in terms of transformation or a data flow and get the desired result
you can write the same solution in pig with minimum number of codes and thus will reduce the development time
you can store the result of max in a variable
instead of this you try to store your max result in a table then use the result of the table as a join in the successive runs
the number of mapper tasks is determined by the input split you have
this is because the textinputformat you have specified produces longwritable the line number as the key and text the line contents as the value
this is because the textinputformat you have specified produces longwritable the line number as the key and text the line contents as the value so the default identity mapper will faithfully emit longwritable and text unchanged
since you have specified outputkeyclass as text there is a class mismatch between the key output of the mapper longwritable and the key type expected by the mapper output collation system text
in practice depending on the exact versions of cloudera you re using you may run into incompatibilities issues such as crc mismatch errors
this is a read only filesystem so distcp must be run on the destination cluster more specifically on tasktrackers that can write to the destination cluster
the strings returned from the trim method are different objects to the string literals that you are comparing against so the if statement blocks are never entered to avoid npe you could use
maybe you should try to correct this line of code into because i notice your reducer class s name is reduce
a bug in the mr version was causing the exception you are seeing
this issue has since been fixed in mahout 0 9
the command is and not by the way since you are on mac osx you can use homebrew package manager to install hadoop
the result just shows how much disk space is available to the hdfs filesystem from the operating systems limitations of all nodes together
what i ve done in similar situations where i have to have multiple conflicting environments is to encapsulate them into functions then when opening a shell execute the appropriate my hadoop env or hadoop env function to pull in the environment you want in that shell
if you re feeling crafty you can even make them modify ps1 so it s clear which one your e in
give it chmod x permissions then from inside the grunt shell you can do sh test sh do get the desired result
i ll list out a couple of issues that might be contributing to your slow performance
you want machines with dedicated local storage since disk i o is generally the largest performance bottleneck
the reason was that version of spark assembly jar in the hdfs differs from your current spark version
you need to override rollinterval to 0 never roll based on time interval
the output is normal because you re having two lines doing wrong things why are you having this code in your reducer you re doing the sum and then you re adding to the output different 1
since you are using as key a word and in each call of reduce you are writing to the output 1 different you will get one of those for each of the words in the input data
this is required because hadoop sorts the keys only before the combiner is called it does not re sort them after the combiner has run
the sorted but actually not sorted list of keys after the combiner has executed is then this list does not get sorted again so the different occurrences of different do not get merged
since you are looking for a cloud based environment to play around i suggest the cloudera live demo which is really the hue demo
i also wanted to learn something about hadoop so i bought a raspberry pi installed raspbian wheezy and hadoop following these instructions
i took hortonworks because there was a very simple setup guide for virtualbox on mac os x
since usually all queues inherit from root queue and the root queue acl is left in default capacity scheduler xml as it follows that normally all queues get acls for all users to be able to submit
until it reaches the root queue at which moment this little snippet of code takes effect also note how queues are loaded from allocationfileloaderservice reloadallocations notice how queue names are actually concatenated with parent queue and root is the implicit parent of all queues
therefore your queue name is truly root queue1
so what that means is that in the fs scheduler all queues by default give access to everybody because they all inherit the root queue default access
the root cause for this has been identified to be https issues apache org jira browse hbase 6658 where it says the class org apache hadoop hbase filter writablebytearraycomparable was renamed
thus caching the whole data set on the cluster with multiple machines might not give significant improvements after calculating a couple of levels of the tree there can be a situation that certain nodeids have a number of rows that can fit in the memory of the mapper or the reducer then you could continue processing that sub tree completely in memory and avoid costly mr job this could reduce the number of mr jobs as you get to the bottom of the tree or reduce the amount of data as the processing gets closer to the bottom another optimisation would be to write a single mr job that in the mapper does the splitting around the selected value of each node and outputs them via multipleoutputs and emits the keys with child nodeids of the next tree level to the reducer to calculate the variance of the columns within the child lists
of cause the first ever run has no splitting value but all subsequent runs will have multiple split values one for each child nodeid
the shebang line is needed because you have several versions of python installed usr bin env will ensure the interpreter used is the first one on your environment s path
it is because the data buffer may get full
you re getting a null pointer exception because the collector variable is null
use the last job s citation count result as input instead of the file cite75 99 txt
you are trying to convert that empty value to number which is invalid and hence you are getting numberformatexception
your pig statements looks good but after filtering data by age you can directly get the firstname and age as result
follow the below statements update here we can even skip flatten statement in both the cases result will be
hdinsight uses azure storage for persistent data so you should be able to create a new cluster and point to the old data as long as you are using wasb for your storage locations
since you are manually downloading files to your computer and running hence it run faster
all it does is run an operator against all of your collection turning it into one result like below last in the example the code is merely running an iterative algorithm over the data to converge on some point
therefore there is no reduce task and no map output as well
this is due to the way the code is structured around aliasing
this can be achieved in two ways 1 run the command using hdfs user 2 change the ownership of the folders using the hdfs user so that you may not face problems while creating directories inside it or using it
therefore if one of your blocks of data gets corrupted somewhere in your cluster there will be other copies of it so you won t lose data
if you set it to 1 then it won t be fault tolerant since it means that there is only one copy per block
depends on need and use of data and size the replication can be set
i was also getting the same error but what i did wrong was copying the wrong path in profile file alias hstart usr local cellar hadoop 2 6 0 sbin start dfs sh usr local cellar hadoop 2 6 0 sbin start yarn sh alias hstop usr local cellar hadoop 2 6 0 sbin stop yarn sh usr local cellar hadoop 2 6 0 sbin stop dfs sh in my case it was 3 0 0 so the path should be usr local cellar hadoop 3 0 0 sbin start dfs sh usr local cellar hadoop 3 0 0 sbin start yarn sh
i took the 2 0 version which supports cdh 4 since that s the hadoop version you said you re using
the zip file also includes the source so you can inspect it
you should not use hadoop dfs instead use the following command do not use instead mention full path like home hadoop hadoop test text2 txt 127 0 1 1 will cause loopback problems
row is an array any so the string that is generated in the prinln function is the one generated by the array s tostring method
you get that error because you haven t add your library in your sparkcontext when you started ipython
since i am not seeing any port forwarding with your scp command and you are providing an actual ip address i will assume that mapr is running a sandbox with the network adapter in bridge mode
if you re running on linux or mac and have chrome or firefox installed bdutil should also print out a copy paste command for starting a fresh isolated browser pre configured to use the socks proxy so that you can click through all the useful links
if you see that the script executes normal on terminal and fails when you execute through the cron then the problem might be mostly because of the environmental differences between the terminal and cron env
the problem could be because of the path variable by which you were directly invoking the hadoop command which might be not fully conveyed to the cron env
lets say you are running the job with 10 mappers currently which is failing because of the data skewness
the var output wc reducebykey v1 v2 v1 v2 collect foreach println itself shows your desired array and its wrong to collect output again because it is unit
if you want the result of reducebykey in form of a local array you should only collect your rdd
the problem is that your output is assigned to the result of a println which returns unit
if you want the result printed you should either just do that directly like or assign the collected result to output and the do a println afterwards like
when we execute hadoop fs ls hadoop by default looks for user current login user since you are facing error no such file or directory it seems that user current login user doesn t exist in hdfs
home recmarch doesn t exist on hdfs and hence error
the reason you are getting filenotfound is because you are trying absolute path from your local filesystem
it is trivial to build spark locally with hive support but it does not have hive support out of the box because of the large number of dependencies hive pulls in
the reason was that i forgot to follow prepare to start the hadoop cluster chapter
for me it s because using wrong version jdk with hadoop
the fs defaultfs value changed in that the link you provided is described as its default value is file meaning the local filesystem of the node in the cluster
the instructions tell you to change fs defaultfs to hdfs localhost 9000 because you want to change the filesystem to hdfs not the local filesystem
only possible reason that i can think of is that there is a different version of antlr in classpath at run time which is causing this error
the error that you are seeing is the failed result of the oozie launcher mapper job which is carrying you pig script to gather resources and run it actually on your cluster
here is the error in the logs i don t see any obvious issues in you script can you run the script in mapreduce mode and check if you get any errors
i am getting results through this method
so first i group a by first column and then group it by 1 so that i have single row python udf is something like below now you use this udf
as mentioned in comments the following error was caused because you were not editing properly
using max min on chararray datatype is not giving you expected results
so i m guessing you re gethttp processor is getting the same file each time and thus the filename attribute will be the same on every flowfile
credit to http nifi rocks getting started with apache nifi which provided the building blocks and thanks to others for comments
for some reason this port was not added by default in cloudera image
seems your metastore server cannot start because the port 9083 is already used by some service
in standard sql you cannot select a column that was not in group by and is not functionally dependent on group by columns
this is because there are in general a bunch of different values for that column per group
you just happen to have got that result
you need to quote t and z or try this if you are not afraid to be clumsy to convert from est to utc use the following multiplication with 1000 is required because from hive language manual
the reason is because your json doesn t follow your table definition try to put each column with a structure with a s string for example
to use merge operation you will need to execute it through the hive jdbc since merge is not supported by spark sql as of this day
spark doesn t support updates or deletes so exception is an expected behavior
you can do the following in pyspark pyspark scala you should have the following result
the second withcolumn changes null to 0 for result column
adding all the values until the current row of result column
so the three withcolumn is equivalent to prev col2 prev results 1 col1 col3
the last withcolumn is changing the null values to 0 in result column
the inputsplit class is responsible for reading the bytes off the filesystem and creating the writable classes which are passed to the mapper
for mysql there is a function called str to date you should call it like this take a look at format specifiers in your case i d try with edit sorry about the mysql stuff don t know if i m supposed to remove it or not anyways for impala this could get you started the casting is because unix timestamp function returns a bigint take a look here for more information about the impala datetime functions
also i m using hiveserver2 for development so i started the processes under root and all the file system tree belongs to root
due to this option i need to use the root user when login to hiveserver2 using beeline i did not need to provide the password since there is no authentication at all
the class org apache nutch crawl crawl has been removed since many years
it s happening because hdfs user cloudera doesn t exist
you can get insight into the error by reading the documentation you correctly placed the argument so that s not the issue you have no comma between the mapper and reducer files you can just pass mapper py if the file is executable and starts with usr bin env python
this sometimes occurs due to jar missing issue
i say seems because i have not tested this solution yet
i just set it to use some nameservice rather then actual address so i think if actual address changes probably this does not affect nifi and hadoop client handles this event
thanks to mattyb for an idea
store clickhouse datadir into hdfs it s a really bad idea cause hdfs not posix compatible file system clickhouse will be extremly slow on this deployment variant you can use https github com jaykelin clickhouse hdfs loader to load data from hdfs into clickhouse and in near future https clickhouse yandex docs en roadmap clickhouse may will be support parquet format for loading data clickhouse have own solution for high availability and clusterization please read https clickhouse yandex docs en operations table engines replication and https clickhouse yandex docs en operations table engines distributed
the error is caused by file using crlf termination instead of expected lf
change the jdbc url and dbtable to the following also note in teradata there are no row locks so the above will create a table lock
jdbc url should be in following form val jdbcurl s jdbc teradata jdbchostname database jdbcdatabase user jdbcusername password jdbcpassword it was causing exception because i didnt supply username and password
it s true there are still known issues due to certain dependencies on actual hdfs the docs were not intended to imply that setting fs defaultfs to a gcs path at cluster creation time would work but to simply provide a convenient example of a property that appears in core site xml in theory it would work to set fs defaultfs to a different preexisting hdfs cluster for example
option 1 is better understood to work because cluster level hdfs dependencies won t change
option 2 works because most of the incompatibilities occur during initial startup only and initialization actions run after the relevant daemons start up already
i think you can directly debug the problem reported by bash command not found by running in the ssh shells on each rpi and comparing the result with the result of probably this will show that mangusta s answer is correct
since you re likely to have follow up troubleshooting like questions which do no really fit so i recommend that you join the troubleshooting on presto community slack
you will need to special case strings though since they are really just iterables of characters
based on your restated question this mapper function might do what you want it looks like you ll probably want to change that return to a yield
so that the runjar class add also the plugins to the classpath but it didn t work
after looking in nutch code i saw that it uses a property plugin folders which controls where can be found the plugins so what i have done and it worked was to copy the plugins subfolder from the job jar to a shared drive and set the property plugin folders to that path each time i run a nutch job
in some cases join especially the replicated kind will cause this type of issue
you may want to investigate which keys are causing hot spots and handle them accordingly
these versions have much better spill to disk detection so that if its about to blow the heap it is smart enough to spill to disk
i guess you re trying this in a proper linux configuration but it would t hurt to do a free m and see what you get in result maybe the problem is due to you having too little swap memory configured
you re mixing old and new api types you re using the old api org apache hadoop mapred lib multipleoutputs with the new api org apache hadoop mapreduce lib output textoutputformat make the apis consistent and you should be ok edit infact 0 20 203 doesn t have a port of multipleoutputs for the new api so you ll have to use the old api find a new api port online cloudera 0 20 2 320 or port it yourself also you should look at the toolrunner class to execute your jobs it will remove the need to explicitly call the genericoptionsparser final point any reference to conf after you create the job instance will be the original conf
job makes a deep copy of the conf object so calling multipleoutputs addnamedoutput conf will not have the desired effect use multipleoutputs addnamedoutput job getconfiguration instead
the du class executes the command du sk dirpath and tries to parse its results
the exception you get indicates that the result standard out is empty
now there you don t use the java api all this line does is setting a property in the xml configuration so you should be able to set it by hand
actually all processes that hadoop should run are not running because of misconfiguration of ip i am not familiar with mac os but on linux and windows we need to put hadoop enteries for connection in hosts files etc hosts and i am damn sure that it should be for mac now the point is you need to put your hadoop entry in that file as a local mnachine like 127 0 0 1actually you need to put it against actual ip of your machine for example hadoop machine 127 0 0 1 placing loop back ip is wrong here because hadoop will try to connect with this ip
but i also found this in the namenode s log file i therefore did a and the problem has gone away
thus the error message was just about the fact that the namenode had not started successfully
there s no particular reason to think that pure sql queries will actually run on hive
i think it is because user is a built in reserved keyword
so that s a pretty ancient version of hbase
this is because hbase stores its data in hadoop so once written the files are read only
a simple fix would be as follows you ll need to cache a version of the job configuration conf in the above code which you can obtain by overriding the configure jobconf method in your reducer be warned though accumulating a list in this way is often the cause of memory problems in your job especially if you have 100 000 values for a given single key
you should try with a 2 x x version or 0 2x version because appending a file on hdfs after hadoop 0 20 2
append is not supported since 1 0 3
i got the problem solved posting it here so that it can help others
my system was a 32 bit while file was of 64 bit so it was giving error
since i am using amazon s emr with s3 i have needed to change the syntax a bit as stated on the following site
pig supports providing file names as regular expressions so you can provide something like and it will load all files with names starting from hlpca in household directory
this is due to the data node problem
hive is the most classic one but is mainly for batch processing since it generates mapreduce code under the hood
since you have all the data in mysql you can use sqoop to pull the data into hdfs and do what you want
basically each aggregation function returns data with it s default data type i don t think so this is the issue while storing it into hive because you already tried pigstore it means it s just data type issue while you are passing it to aggregation
this is may be because of the way you are storing data in hive
it will append bin java to what ever you put in that line
in my case java is the default install in usr bin java so i just set it to usr and it worked
the whole point of using a key value store is so that you can look up things by keys
still there is a chance to be same index in different entries but it is too small which could be less than 0 01 and depends on the processing time of computer for each unit step
try this on reason is partition columns must be last in select statement query
the answer to your question is in the second log address already in use the reason for this is that there s another process using port 4545
this error unsupported major minor version generally appears because of using a higher jdk during compile time and lower jdk during runtime
i realize this is old but in case someone runs into a similar problem here is how i fixed it also might be a different cause but i had recently upgraded from hive 2 1 to hive 2 3
bottom line the problem is caused by an invalid metastore schema for the version being used and the schema must be upgraded to match the hive version
because union function using only mapper not reducer in your case
there s a tool you can use to generate the hive table definition automatically from your json data https github com quux00 hive json schema but you may want to adjust it because when encountering a json object anything between the tool can t know wether to translate it to a hive map or to a struct
on your data the tool gives me this but it looks like you want something like this a few notes though notice i used a different json serde because i don t have on my system the one you used
i used this one i like it better because well i wrote it
the error is caused by invalid types
the error is because of the incorrect value for oozie parameter
a large number of small files don t fit very well with hadoop since each file is a hdfs block and each block require a one mapper to be processed by default
if for example you have a table in hive with many very small files in hdfs it s not optimal better to merge these files into less big ones because when reading this table a lot of mappers will be created
thus taking a closer look at your reducer would be the next step in debug
as long as all files in that path are in the same format you are good to go
an easy way you do that is with column aliases i know you said you didn t want to do this although there was a small typo your query would fail because it would try to name both columns c but hopefully this explains why you should approach it this way you need to build a dataset whose metadata matches the table you want to create
that s because it uses a backdoor built inside hadoop
but then your job has no proper kerberos credentials hence the message you see when you try to do something not covered
how oozie manages authentication without credentials you connect to an edge node create a kerberos ticket with kinit run an oozie command line to submit a coordinator which will fire a workflow at specific dates and times the oozie cli authenticates against the oozie server with the local kerberos ticket so the coordinator and workflow belong to you when the coordinator triggers the workflow and the workflow starts an action and the action starts a yarn job it s the oozie server that authenticates against yarn resourcemanager typically as oozie your kerberos ticket has probably expired long ago but since oozie is defined as a priviledged proxy account in yarn config then the rm accepts to start the job under your account even though you did not properly authenticate via kerberos how is it possible
because internally yarn and hdfs use a delegation token usually you authenticate once with kerberos then you get a token and you are good for all core services on all nodes with oozie in the mix you don t even have to authenticate
linux command ktutil upload that file to hdfs with restricted access because anyone who can get access to that file could then login as you
tell oozie to download the file in the container that runs your java action with file it will be available in the current working dir so you won t have to care about the actual path create a jaas config file that explains to java that whenever the oozie rest server requests authentication via spnego create a kerberos ticket on the fly using this principal whose password is in that keytab file instead of the default which is look for the ticket cache and get an existing ticket there upload that jaas config file to hdfs use another file etc
activate that jaas config with a java system property you will find more details in that post of mine error when connect to impala with jdbc under kerberos authrication disclaimer i don t know which jaas subject is expected by oozie for instance zookeeper expects client hive expects com sun security jgss krb5 initiate alternative forget about jaas and use the cache
original answer which missed the point your hadoop distro seems to be from cloudera and for example cdh 5 10 bundles parquet v1 5 0 which defines its classes in package parquet so these versions are clearly incompatible
edit so incompatible that they do not interfere simply because the package is different
when you run spark executors under yarn by default the classpath contains the jars from both versions of parquet in random order with catastrophic results
that s for class semanticversion and a method with no name which is clearly wrong even a constructor should be be marked with init or sthg similar so i assume the error message got truncated maybe because of character being swallowed by s o
ok let s assume class corruptstatistics was compiled with a call to new semanticversion 1 2 3 a b c which was valid at compile time but for some reason when semanticversion was compiled that constructor was not present release mismatch
that s insane because the official source code cf
that is because dataframe simply does not have map attribute
pig and spark can immediately read the data without accessing hive metastore but you ll still need to parse out columns yourself and depending on the format of the files every field will be a string
that s an aws class so you are going to need to make sure your cp has the exact set of aws java jars your hadoop aws jar was built against
specifically what s happening is that you haven t declared hadoop auth in your pom so your pom gets packaged with the default version of that jar 2 6 1
since that version of hadoop auth is incompatible with the other hadoop jars which are 2 9 1 you get an exception at runtime
since storm core depends on hadoop auth and you haven t declared it explicitly maven will try to guess which version of hadoop auth you need based on where the dependency appears in the tree
since hadoop auth appears as 2 9 1 through some of your hadoop dependencies but 2 6 1 through storm core you happen to get 2 6 1 put in your jar
however it is not recommended for merging small files since it doesn t actually merge the row groups only places them one after the another exactly how you describe it in your question
if you would like to implement it yourself nevertheless you can either increase the heap size or modify the code so that it does not read all of the files into memory before writing the new file but instead reads them one by one or even better rowgroup by rowgroup and immediately writes them to the new file
since you mention that one of your relations is much smaller than the other you might want to optimize your pig scripts
specifically if one of your relations is smaller than the other the smaller relation should go first so that the join is executed more efficiently read more here if one of your relations is so small it can fit into memory you can do a replicate join read more here
note that the order is reverse of the above additionally you can use foreach statements before the join to select only the variables you need so that less data has to be moved around
supports expression language true will be evaluated using flow file attributes and variable registry so you can use expression like creationdate for this parameter
as you can see in your ls tmp is not a directory because it is not prefixed by a d so rm this file if not important and make a directory both with the dfs command
the argument to the csv function does not have to tell about the hdfs endpoint spark will figure it out from default properties since it is already set
in the above case looks like hadoop not was able to find a filesystem for hdfs uri prefix and resorted to use the default filesystem which is local in this case since it is using rawlocalfilesystemto process the path
the connector will try to create temporary tables in order to provide all or nothing semantics which i m expecting is the reason for the exception
you could map the two inputs one mapped by mapper1 and the other mapped by mapper2 and then pass the merged intermediate results into a reducer to get one output
if you want the reduced results of mapper1 to be separate from the reduced results of mapper2 then you need to configure two jobs
write the output to the second file based on conditions in your reduce method
this is due to hadoop running long running tasks on more than a single task tracker and the first one to complete wins while the others are killed off
the result is as expected
since there is no matching it returns all the ip recherchee fields in file2 and puts null in place of fields from a
now you need to set the permissions so that they can be used by hadoop
therefore this mapper works with input files parallely and produce results
this setting basically tells mapreduce to use only your local matlab session to process the data so for small problems this works out to be quicker than the overhead required for running in parallel
there are different reasons to occur this validation error
it is simply because a file with an extension md contains plain text with formatting information
hadoop heavily relies on being able to perform a forward and reverse lookup of the hostname resolve a hostname to an ip forward lookup dns a record resolve an ip to a hostname reverse lookup dns ptr record for a local install i d suggest using etc hosts because the entries in that file provides forward and reverse lookups for each entry
all the nodes in the cluster must be able to resolve the hostnames of all other servers in the cluster therefore your etc hosts file on each server must contain all ip hostname entries for every vbox vm in your cluster
therefore your etc hosts file should include both the output of hostname and hostname fqdn e g
it was caused by java version mismatch because logic and jar is in java8 while emr cluster uses java7 by default
since it is an inner join try selecting wb waybill no
quoting from the apache wiki on hive however the query below does not work this is because the select clause has an additional column b that is not included in the group by clause and it s not an aggregation function either
this is because if the table t1 looked like a b 100 1 100 2 100 3 since the grouping is only done on a what value of b should hive display for the group a 100
124 085 346 080 is way bigger than integer max value which is 2 147 483 647 so it can not be converted to an integer
since the maximum value that integer can store is integer max value 2147483647
sparksession is a part of the spark sql artifact so you need this in your build config
make sure which jar hive do you want because it has diferent versions the old verison jar is here is the mvnrepository and the newest jar is org apache hive jdbc hivedriver here is the new settings check your dependency please
relative and or non fully qualified paths are automatically resolved to fully qualified paths based upon the default file system configured as fs defaultfs in core site xml and defaulting to hdfs on emr and the current working directory which defaults to user
the reason you are encountering a file not found error with your hdfs paths is that for most of your examples you are putting the host name in the wrong place since you have too many slashes before the hostname
you don t actually need to include the hostname though so you can also write hdfs path to file
in most of your examples since you had three slashes and included the hostname it took the hostname to be part of the path and not a hostname at all
i would recommend against using the hostname because then you would need to change the path any time you ran the command on a different cluster
the hive warehouse is different where internal managed hive tables are stored and can be any hadoop compatible fieleystem such as local disk derby is stored either in memory or stored persistently on disk but using mysql or postgres will allow for better performance note hive still requires hadoop libraries so without hadoop isn t possible even if you aren t using yarn or hdfs also property fs default name has been deprecated and replaced by fs defaultfs and must be in the core site xml it s not a valid hive site property yes you are via hive default properties javax jdo option connectionurl jdbc derby databasename metastore db create true
the following command will not work since the directory is not created in your local filesystem but in hdfs
about the log4j warning you can ignore that as it will not cause your hadoop commands to fail
please check your path and hadoop home configuration and update these variables accordingly
that is probably because you haven t given it the location where it needs to pick the files from
following code works and produces exact output as specified in the tutorial dump join data note line runs filter runs raw by runs 0 is additional than what has been provided by hortonworks thanks to eugene for sharing working code which i used to modify original hortonworks code to make it work
i am having the same exact same issue with exact same log output but this solution doesn t work because i believe changing max with avg here dumps the whole purpose of this hortonworks com tutorial it was to get the max runs by playerid for each year
update finally i got it resolved you have to either remove the first line in batting csv column names or edit your pig latin code like this after that you should be able to complete tutorial correctly and get the proper result
it also looks like this is due to the bug in the older versions of pig rhich was used in the tutorial
first of all textoutputformat setoutputpath job1 new path outputpath is important because when the job is run this path is taken as a work directory by hadoop to create temporary files and such for different tasks temporary dir
that fileoutputcommiter class defines a function such as this since markoutputdirsuccessful is private you have to instead override commitjob to bypass the succeeded file name creation process and achieve what you want
i think when you use the same output directory as an input to another job the file success and directory logs will get ignored due to filter set in hadoop
found the reason of the problem after about 36 hours of downtime
but still presence of in causes problem atleast in version 0 14 0 of pig
the character is not visible so it s understandable that you didn t realize that it was there
for some reason when i am in cloudera terminal and being as normal user it was giving me error as you mentioned just entered in as a super user as below and tried running pig being a root
for some reason they were not applicable when the job was running
you can get unexpected results
i did not have this environment variable set so i simply stopped yarn set it to equal to java home and started it back up
usually if do that it should give error but since the foreach function would execute all the items in parallel thread you are getting this error you can give separate directories for each thread like this or else you can also have subdirectories under hdfspath like this
your premise that so it should have performance issue when compared to java map reduce jobs
maybe hive was a few seconds slower sometimes but i can t really tell if that was hives performance or my vm that was hanging due to low memory
so either put it there which is highly recommended you should always stick to standards unless there is a serious reason to do it otherwise or specify sourcedirectory in build section
use the hadoop fs command to access contents of these files note that the construct requires bash thus your script needs to start with bin bash not bin sh
the exact cause of the exception is that the number 1439284609013 is too big to fit into integer
based on the header lines 1 means running and 2 means succeeded
see comments feel free to read up on hive date functions if you get no results you should check the source data to see what recon dt actually is
virtual box i used version 4 3 16 r95972 available here old vb builds centos 7 minimal iso file from http www centos org download winscp version 5 7 4 https winscp net eng download php this walk through consists of 4 phases create a centos appliance inside virtualbox that can support building hadoop add ssh capabilities to the appliance so that downloaded prerequisites can be scp ed from the host to the guest vm install all the things utilities and dependencies needed to build hadoop build hadoop without errors phase 1 creating a centos appliance for virtualbox start by opening virtualbox and clicking on the new button in the top left corner
ls l etc ssh rm rf etc ssh ssh key systemctl restart sshd ls l etc ssh now that we have an ssh daemon up and keys generated we are going to test the connection
we do that with the following one line command yum y install gcc c x86 64 next we need to install git so that we can pull down the hadoop source code
http localhost 50070 node manager is not working because you run command prompt without administrator rights
i know this is an old post but i recently needed to solve this problem and couldn t find a complete solution out there for mr2 and yarn testing so i wanted to share what i found http www lopakalogic com articles hadoop articles hadoop testing with minicluster hope it helps someone
therefore i guess that the resourcemanager is the jobtracker and nodemanager is the tasktracker in this case
may be it is not showing in jps for some reason
hdfs namenode format error could not find or load main class xyz you are getting this error maybe because your username contains white space or blank space like amit kumar pavan singh etc
since your question is how can i run hadoop based on the sources generated from maven
from the input tuple you are passing as argument to the udf get the column which you want in your result then add it to the databag then return this databag from your udf
i have the same problem but i did not configure yarn because of some jobs are running
alter table d study add column cto id string update d study set cto id cto1101 row id the syntax depends on the db system as well as the data types so for hive just search for the concatenation opperator or a predefined function
the root cause of the issue seems space related
i reverted the configuration files to default and compressed intermediate results configuration files to get the result
as you have found out the problem is because hadoop or rather the underlying apache common net ftpclient defaults to the ftp active mode which hardly works nowadays due to ubiquitous nats and firewalls
since hadoop 2 9 you can set up ftp passive mode by setting fs ftp data connection mode configuration option to enable the ftp passive mode see https issues apache org jira browse hadoop 13953
we re having the same issue here since a couple of weeks
if the problem is a header just replace the line that causes the problem with so if the value is invalid the method will terminate without crashing
java heap error may caused by the much number of tasks
java heap error may caused by the much number of tasks so you can consider to create a range partition by month table to reduce the num of tasks
the error you re getting is because bad boys in your case is superuser
therefore what i want to do easily write m r jobs using hbase tables as both sink and source will be possible in their next release
before someone commits suicide the problem is caused by a mismatch between the hbase jar versions available in the central maven repository currently 0 90 xx and those used by cloudera s cdh3 installation package 0 89 xx
i can t be sure since there is no code provided
although not the cause of the problem in your case it s worth noting that this error can occur when trying to insert into a column family where the specified partition key doesn t exist
it sounds like the namenode started the namenode is responsible for storing directory information but the datanode did not start the datanode stores the data
also to note startup of cluster is much slower so one has to wait some time eg 1 minute before the dfs is running so it may give the impression it is not working same stand for the start of mapred which does wait for the dfs to run and takes its own time
a workaround method i m using right now that works consists of copying all the relevant files over to the jobcache working directory
then you can copy the results back to user directory if necessary
and here is the ldd result after linking
you want to make sure all libraries are resolved when you run it since it eventually runs java byte code you also need to set classpath
finally you obviously will have to look at the results after the job is done running
either use num mappers 1 so that there is no need for sqoop to divide up the work or use split by with a date or numeric column to override the default
you need to create a partioner class first that partions based on your criteria
the problem was that the particular version of jvm java tm se runtime environment build 1 6 0 29 b11 had bug and caused the client to hang in the getconnection method
i think the cause is because i was using deprecated version of map reduce which use mapred
since hadoop is java and doesn t know about cygwin mappings it takes tmp to mean c tmp
based on your comment you re probably is most probably related to the hosts file
secondly have you set up hadoop and hbase to run with external accessible services i m not too up on hbase but for hadoop the services need to be bound to non localhost addresses for external access so your masters and slaves files in hadoop home conf need to name the actual machine names or ip addresses if you don t have a dns server
in hadoop hadoop metrics properties configuration settings contains settings for the metrics contexts dfs mapred and jvm so you can edit the dfs section as below first stop the hdfs service
cloudera scm fails because it is not able to use yum to download and install jdk
you can update yum repository on the machines yourself depending on what version of linux you are using
since there are no output that has been captured that could be used to debug the output i can only speculate
but from my past experience one of the common reason hadoop jobs fail when they are spawned through scripts is that hadoop home is not available when these commands are executed
try adding the following to both bashrc and bash profile or profile you may have to change the path based on your specific installation
1 i copied the jar library to hadoop using 2 i then modified my configuration as below 3 the tutorial then says use the cached file in mapper so my mapper looks like this despite doing all these the code still fails by throwing class bout found
according to the hadoop the definitive guide it s practically not possible for an application level synchronization because of the nature of hadoop multiple nodes mappers reducers etc
hdfs files are not mutable so you can only append to them
the reason behind this issue is https issues apache org jira browse hadoop 8870 i was also facing this same problem and solved it by making a slight change in the pattern and zero code
configuration files depends on hadoop home path
i think you should use the command as given below because copyfromlocal expects first argument to be a local file and the second argument to be a location in hdfs hadoop fs copyfromlocal tmp temp pattern bs conf user hdfs hadoop qa2 bs
1 add your hbase jars into hadoop class path because your map reduce doesn t by default configure to hbase jars
the problem stemmed from the fact that i was adding to the cache local files
therefore your disk space isn t being hogged by the datanodes rather by the tasktrackers and restarting them forces a clearing of those directories
you probably have considered this already but it might be quicker if you change the parts of your pig script that are dependent on 0 9 2 to work on 0 1 0
also last place to store nn data is hdfs since you will get egg and chicken problem
looks like you picked up the wrong package name in the mapper and are therefore casting to a difference class even though its name is intpairwritable too
i could solve the issue of cloudera successfully adding a host and not showing it in the host list by following changes in all the host machines including the one having cloudera manager add similar contents to etc hosts file note i have removed the default entry localhost localdomain 127 0 0 1 localhost 1 localhost6 localdomain6 localhost6 x x x x master cloudera mydomain master y y y y slave1 cloudera mydomain slave1 add this extra search entry to etc resolv conf keep the default search entry as it is search cloudera mydomain restart system network interface for the changes to take effect
you can get the task attempt id for the currently running hadoop task and that would be unique across all mappers and thus could be used as filenames
i would suggest to select map only solution over reduce only solution for the performance reasons
it loads both cpu serialization disk since all data stored on disk at least once and network to pass data
taking onto account your data size and considering that during shuffling data will grow because of serialization overhead i would also consider map only solution in order not to get out of disk space
however the reduce only version seems to me more typical for a map reduce job implemented in hadoop as the framework itself will be responsible for grouping the files
however efficiency it is strictly dependent on the computation that has to be performed
therefore in your system the correct order may be g wordcount cpp o a l home pc run hadoop install hadoop lib native lhadooppipes lhadooputils lpthread i home pc run hadoop install hadoop include wall hope this helps le quoc do
c main problem i see is to run hive job as result of the client s web request
also note that gzip files aren t splittable even if they are located on s3 so you might either need to use a splittable format e g lzo or an uncompressed data to exploit the desired level of parallel processing
127 0 0 1 is a loopback address so connections will only be accepted from the vm itself
if it doesn t work with a large number of files it s probably because you ve hit the max number of files that can be served by a datanode
the former of these issues never manifests in elastic mapreduce because jobtrackers are only ever started once and are destroyed upon job completion
the second however can fall victim to a check in the org apache hadoop mapreduce jobsubmissionfiles class depending on which version of hadoop you are using
it turned out to be that i forgot to deploy mapreduce client configuration so my entire cluster was running in local mode solved
as people in cloudera mail list suggest there are probable reasons of this error the hdfs safemode is turned on
as visible datanode is not up on your system same is the probable reason for could only be replicated to 0 nodes instead of 1 it happens sometimes
while loading choose the replication as 1 so that the blocks are not replicated
the cause should show up in the logs
below is my hdfs directory structure ps you may have any version of serde jar i used json serde 1 3 jar with dependencies jar specifically because i found in other answer that this version supports deserialization as well and it worked for me
map function is data preparation stage where mapper can prepare and filter the data so that it can pass the same as input to reducer function
as per my understanding three things in hive query will lead to reducer function
most of the rest will lead to mapper function
hive will try to optimize the number of map reduces it does and the work between map and reduce as much as it can based on the query
if you want to control the map reduce behavior you can write your own map reduces in java the whole point of hive is that it will let you use a familiar syntax sql to express the results you want to get and it would create an efficient map reduce sequence to get that result for performance reasons you probably want to get as much work as possible in the map phase since there are usually more mappers than reducers and you don t need to move data around
the fs default name tells hadoop the filesystem uri to use so it should be pointed to the local disk
in core site xml you should define in mapred site xml you should define since hadoop tmp dir is pointed to the nfs drive then the default locations of mapred system dir and mapreduce jobtracker staging root dir point to locations on the nfs drive
don t run start all sh or start dfs sh because those will start hdfs
if you run multiple datanodes that point to the same nfs directory then one datanode will lock that directory and the others will shutdown because they are unable to obtain a lock
i also tried it gave me the same output as when i run it in standalone so i assume it is performing correctly
add the following 2 lines in your code if you don t specify this your client will look into the local fs which doesn t contain the specified path hence throwing that error
hadoop by default uses a default hash partitioner click here which is something like the key hashcode integer max value numreducetasks will return a number between 0 to numreducetasks and in your case the range would be 0 to 5 since numruducetask 6 the catch is there in that line itself two such statement may return you the same number
and as a result two different keys could go to the same reducer
you need to include the mapred java archive depending on which mapreduce version you use mrv1 or mrv2 yarn
this may be caused by a directory created another user e g
hence sbin folder should be in the path
you may also get this message due to permissions eg if jt can not create jobtracker info on startup
check the contents of each nodes etc hosts file to check they are correct and preferably know about each other node in the cluster so you can avoid dns lookup costs
i m not saying this is the cause of your problem but it certainly isn t right and should be something you track down
number of possible reasons is too much
specifically listdirectory since is a reserved symbol in regular expressions
not sure if this could be the exact reason
if you are familiar with hdfs java api libhdfs is just a wrapper of org apache hadoop fs fsdatainputstream so it can not read compressed files directly now
might be this link helps you invoking program through java jar used in pig and also give complete path of your jar file so that hadoop can locate it from anywhere
at least in my case execresp getoperationhandle returned null because there was an error in the executed request that generated execresp
this didn t throw an exception for some reason and i had to examine execresp in detail and specifically check the status before attempting to get an operation handle
this is caused by not heavy write but big write
your intuition was correct in that you need to group the data first before using min
most probably the name of hadoop examples jar is not correct because in my version of hadoop 1 0 0 file name is hadoop examples 1 0 0 jar
i had this issue in hadoop 1 2 1 deployed on mac os x 10 10
i pulled my hair off and at the end it was because of a stuck service
since it is running fine with the hive shell can you check if the user with which you are running the hive shell and the java program with jdbc are the same
with such a environment set up the ability to run map reduce jobs were all based on permissions
i was able to issue simple queries such as select from sample 07 and receive a result but running select count from sample 07 would throw a jdbc error
from the docs because you were creating strings as arguments to the into array clojure properly created a string array for you
th reason why select works and select count doesn t is that latter involves a mr job
query 1 will give results whereas query 2 will give an error
in any case the confusion was due to scarce error reporting by the hadoop nativeio class
therefore you can just do resulting schema and output
this might be because the output of mapper was removed
one of the reason for this might be due to the quota allocated for the user
i have recently evaluated cassandra and couchbase among other options for a client requirement so i can shed some light on both datastores
i assume you have correctly installed your lzo libraries you should have libgplcompression so in your lib natives linux and the jar file in your lib folder since you have them the correct class should be lzodeprecatedtextinputformat class or lzotextinputformat class depending on wich api you use according to your post you are using it right job with lzotextinputformat
however if you write a mapreduce job to output some files i assume you use textoutputformat some custom output format may change the following behaviour the file block size is determined by the configuration of the tasktracker
because the job configuration will be commited to the tasktracker
looks like some classpath related issue since your setup is bypassing whatever you have configured in your core site xml
my job tracker runs on 8021 so the configuration is as follows i faced such an issue due to missing properties
hi kumar this is due to my master node service automatically starts stops
possible solution is first flatten filter and than group again another way is writing custom filterfunc so it s up to you what to choose
there is no reason to use a synonym
there you will find config ini file in that you will find server host address
this is because you have imported org apache hadoop hbase hbaseconfiguration but the class you need is unicredit spark hbase hbaseconf
note that you don t have a sparkcontext instance yet only a streamingcontext so first create one
you have an aggregation function and in order to get the result you want you need to use group by parameters or arguments expression1 expression2 expression n expressions that are not encapsulated within an aggregate function and must be included in the group by clause at the end of the sql statement http www techonthenet com sql group by php this is probably because the same rule exist in hiveql as well
based on your similar question earlier i think you have some existing hdfs files in csv format that contain the data you want to query right
in general you have three problems to solve create tables in hive so the hive megastore knows about their structure
thus if you use a version of spark which is built for hadoop 2 6 you will be able to access hdfs filesystem of a cluster with the version 2 6 of hadoop via spark
the reason why it happens is because i use spark executor extraclasspath with prefix home some user
it seems that spark can not load any class from that path because spark process owner is another user once i putted jar to path smth like usr lib everything works fine
sorry i cannot comment cause less than 50 rep what does ls l start hbase sh return
please read carefully posting a question when you post a data related question supply a data sample source data required results
there is no reason what so ever to use sub queries in order to narrow the columns list
as it s passing 3 as an argument to when the result only contains 2 columns and the valid column indexes are 1 and 2
based on your code i don t find that your code matches the description
masterprocwals are used by master nodes here is a description given by the apache hbase reference guide so masterprocwals contain ddls procedures not applied by the active hbase master on the permanent storage
try to figure out the root cause of the problem the number of wal files should not increase over the time
try to restart a master check in its log because it will read the masterprocwal files during its startup
no such file or directory because the output of echo hdfs user whoami does not exist yet and you need to make it using hadoop fs mkdir p hdfs user whoami
hdfs sink allows rolling the data into hdfs based on the following criteria
hdfs rollsize hdfs rollinterval hdfs rollcount it rolls the data based on the above parameters combination and file name are having predefined pattern
flume also produces n number of files based on rolling criteria
it was due to building spark with java7
as there is no display on the console and you are sure file is not empty it means there is error in opening the file which is due to the invalid path of the file
you need to replace the empty catch block with allowing to print the stack trace so you can see the error occuring
if you were storing numbers then the raw binary representation is determined by what the serialization class of the number was
more likely it s some chunk of bytes like 1a34e56c etc depending on the output serialization format
50070 is hdfs service which every hadoop system has therefore i suggested it
edit new answers based on the extra details you provided 1 no the way you describe it is the only way to do it in pig
that is the only explanation i can find to your results because the default partitioner used by group by sends all instances of a key to the same reducer thus giving you the results you expect
from the apache pig documentation the way to do this is as follows 2 you shouldn t need to use parallel 1 to get your desired result
i know for sure that this has caused me problems
you actually want to run junit so assuming your jars are in the current directory use
sometimes not setting up these environment variables may also cause error while starting the hadoop cluster
list all ports that are listening you can connect to them using telnet netstat nap grep listen here open probably means some process is listening for connections in that port
i m not sure if it still applies but on a cloudera cluster without kerberos you could fake a login by setting an environment parameter hadoop user name on the command line for machine to machine communications tools like storm kafka solr or spark are not secured by ranger but they are secured by kerberos so only dedicated processes can use those services
source https community cloudera com t5 support questions kerberos ad ldap and ranger td p 96755 update apparently kafka and solr integration has been implemented in ranger since then
this error is thrown since the table created has a column of bigint and we are trying to insert an int value insert into table1 as select field1 field2 email cast field3 as bigint field4 from v table2
because the column is already an array you can just get the elements by indices
i think i got the answer because my computer have 8 gib memmory when i use the command it takes time to all the services to startup we can see the status of all the services with the command the location of all the services is etc init d so i suggest not to try get in the hue immediately after the container is startup
getas string i is the same as therefore it is just a type casting
because df is the original dataframe and df count attempts to return column that is not in the original dataframe dataframes are immutable objects that can not be modified you can only queue transformation that return new dataframes without modifying the original dataframe thus groupby and agg does not modify the original df dataframe but return new dataframes with the queued transformations spark is lazy
key has to be only one value so it has to be primitive i e string int bigint however your code tries to put key as array and so the error
most long running java applications will do this due to the multiple threads running
the reason this doesn t matter is because typical hadoop workloads are i o bound not cpu bound
alright so it seems the problem was with specifying the principal p this fails p admin admin holograph tor indexww com this succeeds p admin admin kadmin apparently automatically adds the realm name after the principal and was failing on that nothing to do with not finding the kdc server at all
so it appears that we had 2 paths that target the same directory at dfs namenode name dir which caused the double lock
happy you are encountering a known bug in structured streaming https issues apache org jira browse spark 25257 this is because the offset from disk is never deserialized and the fix will be merged in coming release
when spark submit the job to the yarn resource manager it draws a logical and physical execution plan based on data size partition data locality and accordingly the number of executors is planned and it all happens automatically
you can still configure of executor required however whether to run them in a single node or in the different nodes in the cluster or in the specific node that depends on data locality and kind of job you have submitted
then it s not clear how you are linking that to hdfs so i suggest giving the full path to the namenode try this if you want to do tweet text analysis i might suggest spark rather than just hive though
the init and start method are derived from the abstractservice class
asia kolkata is 05 30 after before utc so that makes some sense and the timezone config only applies to the path format values not internal values of your kafka records
i m not sure which tool you are using to query with but it might be a problem there because i have had some tools assume the data is only written in utc time then the tool will shift and display a formatted local timestamp
therefore i would suggest making the hdfs sink connector actually write in utc time then let your sql tools and operating system handle the actual tz conversions themselves
same goes for impyla btw so it s your responsibility to set custom session properties from your python code e g
since sqoop also support hive tables which further has dependencies on other hadoop ecosystem projects it needs support tools and libraries
you can do this using several components tfilelist to list files in a repository here tmp then you have to extract the first part of your filename with java code tjava data01 data txt and put the result in a global var for example then a tfilecopy to copy your file in the repository name that you store in the global var i hope it will help you
you re just running a shell command so you can use command evaulation for example to rename a file to have yyyy mm dd
judging by the file system shell guide documentation it is not currently supported from the command line so you will need to implement this in java after this data txt and header txt both cease to exist replaced by datawithheader txt
in this specific case it is due to the fact that though the tutorial has several topics they are not independent
hence the code from the first topic squoop import is needed to ensure that the data is actually in place for the spark section
depending on the output the correcting action might be different
if that is the case i believe we can make use of the escaping functionality in the opencsv library using tabs as your delimiting character instead of commas to correctly populate the user review field http opencsv sourceforge net in this example we are reading one line from the input that is passed in and parsing it into columns base on the tab character and placing the results in the nextline array
in the example that you pasted above i think even that split n will be problematic as tabs within a user review split into two results in the result in addition to new lines being treated as new records
validate each line at the start of the map method so that you know line 4 exists and isn t null
by default mapreduce passes each line into the map method independently so if you do want to read multiple lines as one message you ll have to write a custom inputsplit or pre format your data so that all data for each review is on the same line
instead i was lucky in that the delimiter had quotations on either side of the pipe
instead i was lucky in that the delimiter had quotations on either side of the pipe so it looks like
this turns the values between the quotes into strings so the additional pipes in those column values don t act as delimiters
you need to delete space before path at hadoop prefix because the correct syntax to assign a variable is name value
this is a time to live and should depend on the amount of available disk space you have
you can also increase the logging level to find the cause
please check dynamic resource allocation is enabled spark dynamicallocation enabled true this will use as many as it can depends up on the system rescue availability this may be causing the problem
after a long search i found that the reason the application could not load the class org apache spark deploy yarn applicationmaster is because this isn t the version of applicationmaster the emr core instance uses it uses org apache hadoop yarn applications distributedshell applicationmaster which requires the classpath segment in the input to include usr lib hadoop yarn
problem was because of different file systems
it is because of space character in program files
since you have not faced any issue with external table not sure if this is going to solve your problem
i guess you are facing this problem while reading the table you can confirm from your spark ui since spark is lazy when you triggered an action it actually started reading the table and you have encountered this problem
it might be that can t redefine io confluent connect avro connectdefault is because your transform is setting a schema property
note parquetformat uses the parquet avro project so the data probably should be avro to begin with
therefore you would need to write a protofuf avro converter somewhere
maybe using skeuomorph kafka streams or similar process between your producer and connect the easiest of these options modify the kafka connect hdfs project so that protobuf could be handled modify the protobufconverter code so that it generates a connectrecord of avro data if all else fails you could file an issue about it and see what you get
i solved it the problem was that zeppelin was using a commons lang3 3 5 jar and spark using commons lang 2 6 jar so all i did is to add the jar path to zeppelin configuration on the interpreter menu 1 click interpreter menu in navigation bar
but sparkjdbc solution is based on spark in memory execution engine with well proven performance record and reliable to use
after that you can revert back the changes once you have found your black sheep file causing the issue you can check for local files var log as hadoop works on top of disk space of system also check for the directories mentioned in hadoop tmp dir use hadoop fs rmr on all data nodes and name node to flush
it seems you gave input as the output directory for the wordcount of myfile txt mapreduce jobs will not overwrite the contents of the output directory if one already exists and therefore will fail
the second one contains also the error code so no need to log both of them
therefore i copied ssh folder from host to container in each host
my problem is with the extraneous double quotes around the actual guts of the json data that was causing a problem when spark was trying to read it
it is very hard to tell since you don t provide any information about which version of software you are using
so if you were to look at your cluster s overall cpu utilization and memory utilization you should be able to resize your containers based on the wasted spare capacity
in case somebody get the same issue it s because hadoop configuration
you are getting this error because hmaster process is not running
you re using the name count for one of your relations which could lead to ambiguity as to whether you mean the alias count or the function count
projected field id does not exist in schema group chararray tweetdata bag tuple userid chararray userdata bag tuple id chararray this is because id is nested within the bag userdata so you would need to specify count userdata id
your cluster metrics show you have no vcores no memory and no active nodes so that means you cannot do any processing until you add a node manager to your cluster
the reason you see this when doing a distinct is that hive can process some queries without triggering a mapreduce job
the ip of my system had changed due to which hive was not running properly
based on my understanding for some unknown reason the spark submit provided by the distribution spark 2 4 0 bin hadoop2 7 tgz will exclude any packages of hadoop that is compiled together in your application
the reason why was the nosuchmethoderror error raised is because the method reloadexistingconfiguration does not exist until hadoop version 2 8 x
my solution is to use the separate distribution of spark 2 4 0 without hadoop tgz while connecting it to hadoop 3 0 0 so that it will use the correct version of hadoop even if spark submit excluded the packages in your application during execution
in addition since the packages would be excluded by spark submit anyway i would not create a fat jar during compilation through maven
all your partitions are under user test partition trial directory inside test directory that s the reason msck repair table is not able to find newly added partitions
you have already got the issue in log your namenode fails to start because of issue in core site xml fs defaultfs configuration
since you re running this in mesos you cannot use gui mode
the main reason for failure of some operations via webui is permissions issue as the default user for it is drwho ex permission denied user dr who access write inode suyash supergroup drwxr xr x
i was in your position with these tutorial youtube and problem so the main problem is in hadoop version tutorial use hadoop 2 7
however if you are looking to use different regular queries and then join them inside nifi i would find it rather difficult but possible with mergerecord or mergecontent because nifi is not exactly built for joining queries
when you change the enctype you must also recreate the principal or at least update the principal s password so i did the reset of the password netdom trust xyz domain abc com reset realm passwordt xxxxxxxxxxx also kvno no wasnt matching between ad and hadoop so i updated the kvno at hadoop side restarted the following services on hadoop server sbin service krb5kdc restart sbin service kadmin restart and voila i was able to run the kvno command
this is probably because the ambari version you are using doesn t support this version of ubuntu this means in reality that ambari is not yet officially tested against that version
use sqoop 2 and make all sql queries uppercase it s a known issue in kylin
this is because iam will assign credentials to an identity instead of to the service instance or storage account the terminology can be inconsistent
typically the primary reason to have multiple instances is to provide for more granularity in billing there s no practical restriction on the amount of data in an instance or the number of objects in a bucket although the number of buckets in an instance should be limited to the hundreds in most cases
found my error because i m calling pandas read csv after i open the happybase connection the connection times out
because spark shell is used for interactive queries thus the spark driver must be runing on your host not as a container inside the cluster
a lot of cpu and time is consumed in the i o itself hence you can t experience the processing power of spark
permission denied issue at hadoop installation in the above link you can find the reason for the issue
and for anyone else with this problem note that i did not stop all the services that the docs want you to stop since using centos7 also note that i did not follow any of the config file settings recommended in the docs and that some of the properties instructed in the docs could not even be found in the ambari managed hdfs configs so if anyone can explain why this is still working for me despite that please do
changed the hostname of my servers for the fqdn tried to nslookup my hostnames didn t work since they are specified in etc hosts it didn t do anything i m still getting the error
i do not know why it struggles so hard to find my servers since hadoop has absolutely no problem with it
as per log filenotfound error is due to executor failure and executor failed due to too many open files
also this is not a dependency version conflict since you re not using the same dependency with two different versions at build time but you re using one most probably older version on the server at runtime that doesn t yet contain the method you refer to
i will go back to using sasl since it looks way simpler to implement and run
not a lot of folders were affected by this issue so it didn t take a long time
there s no official documentation because hadoop doesn t support windows
like in this demo result
i think i was allowed to create the files but not write to them because i think i accessed the namenode but when i accessed the datanode i gave the error
the problem was we were creating the oozie database with another user and hence it was not able to connect
i did this based on the fact that these block pool id s didn t exist in the other data node and by looking through the local filesystem i could see the files under these id s hadn t been updated for a while
fwiw in s3a we re looking at what it d take to actually dynamically change the header for a specific query so you go beyond specific users to specific hive spark queries in shared clusters
i realized it because of an exception thrown in aws emr that i see sometimes part of its stack trace was i m posting the answer here to future references
you could set up 2 queues and enable the maxresources in that queue job a runs on so it cannot take all the resources
there are a number of bugs which make it difficult unless you know what is the root cause like in this case
the cause here is that when giraph is sending the jars to the hdfs from where there should be accessible to the workers it uses one location to upload and another to download hence workers cannot find the file
i got a similar error but the reason in my case was that i used an aggregatorwriter and had to delete the file of the writer from the previous run
there are guides out there depending on your vm
this is likely similar to application failed 2 times due to am container exited with exitcode 1
essentially the code you pasted does not contain the actual error code so we cannot help much with it
you need to filter out the results in the reducer
i m not sure if your example is correct because it uses coord minutes
even if minutes n was supported your range does not look correct because your start and end interval are backwards
made the following environment variable settings in hbase home conf hbase env cmd provided java home is set beforehead in this case java home c program files java jdk1 8 0 101 set in windows environment variable since running in standalone mode add only the following property in hbase home conf hbase site xml imp no need to add hbase rootdir or hbase zookeeper property datadir
if the goal is to write the output of beeline to hdfs file then below options should work fine since both commands will pipe the standard output of beeline to hadoop commands as input which is recognized by
it s a little unclear based on your question and comments on why can t you use the suggestion given by cricket 007 and why to go for a beeline in particular
that s why the workaround for now is to convert case in the select statement so it goes to the right bucket
this snippet results in this output
both ioexception and interruptedexception are checked hence the method reduce isn t overridden
the method reduce in class reducer does not throw any exception and hence you cannot declare that the method reduce in your subclass throws any checked exceptions but it can throw unchecked exceptions
depending on what your delimeter is use a line like this to get the text with the max time along with creating a method that gets the communication time from a string text like this the boolean option for the stream is if you want sequential false or parallel true if your delimiter is different or the object is a little different you may need to adjust getcomtime but this should be pretty close to right
this solution appears to fix the problem for now pick either opt sqlanywhere17 lib32 or opt sqlanywhere17 lib64 based on 32 bit 64 bit requirements create a symbolic link to your current jdk path and jvm path open permissions for accessing opt sqlanywhere17 java if you installed as root ensure user is part of hadoop group for sqoop folder permissions env add the default exports to any user running the sqoop command ln s opt sqlanywhere17 lib64 usr jdk64 jdk1 8 0 112 jre lib amd64 ln s opt sqlanywhere17 lib64 usr lib jvm java 1 8 0 openjdk 1 8 0 222 b10 1 el7 7 x86 64 jre lib amd64 chmod 755 r opt sqlanywhere17 usermod a g hadoop user for user executing sqoop cat opt sqlanywhere17 bin64 sa config sh bashrc cat opt sqlanywhere17 bin64 sa config sh bash profile
mapreduce defaults to read line delimited files so your json objects would have to be one per line such as from the mapper you would parse the text objects into jsonobject like so if you only have one json object in the file then you probably shouldn t be using mapreduce
this is because hadoop doesn t know how to serialise double but does know how to serialise doublewritable
thus in the following i try to concentrate on potential issues i can see from the script and error messages when starting containers without rm they will remain in place after being stopped
afterwards that fails due to the container already being existent
other general scripting advice prefer bash e causes the script to stop on unhandled errors
one might argue that this goes partially against the spirit of the isolation of containers to be dependent on the environment like this but a lot of docker environments are used for testing purposes where this is not the primary concern
when scripting one needs to implement all these things separately which will often result in less complete solutions
another interesting feature although not so easy as it sounds is the ability to deploy docker compose yml files to docker clusters
i could not test the docker compose yml file because the image spark hadoop latest does not seem to be available through docker pull but the file above might be enough to get an idea
see where you have if values iterator next get missing well you never saved the value so that means you threw it away
another problem is that you are adding incorrectly for some reason you are trying to add two values for every iteration of the loop
you should be adding one so your loop should look like this the next obvious problem is that you put your output line inside your while loop that means that every time you read an item into your reducer you write an item out
in that case you shouldn t have your output inside the loop
distinct or dropduplicates is not an option since you can t control which values will be taken
two approaches based on your size of product scores data if your product scores file is not huge you can load that up in hadoop distributed cache
therefore you need to provide a valid json and simply wrap the type in double quotes like this nb also do not add the type suffix or it won t work just the name of the sparksql type such as string or long
i would use the linux console to mount the s3 bucket and then move files from there to hdfs in that fashion
to access the namenode ui you d use localhost 9870 since that s the port you ve forwarded
the real error should be available in the yarn ui but putting the probability as the key won t allow you to sum all the values at once because they all would end up in different reducers if you have no key to group the values by then you can use this which should funnel all data to one reducer print s t s none probability mass here is a working example for the output that you wanted which i tested with just an input file not in hadoop output you can test your code without hadoop with cat file txt python mapper py sort u python reducer py plus mrjob or pyspark are higher level languages that would provide more useful features
based on my experience i think there are three solution can be used in your current scenario as below
directly use hadoop api for hdfs to get hdfs metrics data in spark because hadoop azure just implements the hdfs apis for using azure blob storage so please see the hadoop offical document for metrics to know what particular metrics you want to use such as createfileops or filescreated as the figure below to get numberoffilescreated
i think chlevel1 is being null because the string couldn t be parsed to your object class also you should only do new gson once preferably as a static field
you need to export your results to a file then download it and plot it as two separate steps
mapreduce has no gui and you shouldn t have each reducer task trying to generate a plot or you can export the results to some gcp tool like bigquery or datastore where you can plug in proper bi tools for visual analytics
you should use java 8 since spark depends heavily on some of the java 8 features that where either made private deprecated or removed in java 9 and above
try dump and describe for your every result set to see the output of each alias used
refer scalar has more than one row in the output modifications i used space in the input files as delimiter so used pigstorage in filterr i removed the opening and closing round braces around studentsr name studentsr rollno resultr result since output of dump was having additional round braces
dump results
and 3 0 0 snapshot is not there naturally because maven central doesn t host snapshot artifacts
the real reason was the customer did not set their kerberos cert in the hive thrift server for cross realm authentication
the yarn application master picks a node at random to run the calculation based on information available from the namenode where files are stored
if your file isn t larger than the hdfs block size there is no reason to fetch the data from other nodes
thus my statement was incorrect
the view is being created by sqoop based on query value
hence the user running the job must have cv right granted on the database
you can use this statements to create a column and update it based on value from another one
as far as i know there is no single command to achieve the results you re looking
for the provided sql on table tab1 the actual logic is like explode field secondary tertiary alias it as lv which results in a temporary result set table tab2 a join like operation to concatenate tab2 s fields back to rows in tab1 resulting in another intermediate table tab3 select from tab3 upon which where conditions are applied
i did solve this issue in fact i needed to add this lines in the advanced topology knox in ambari ui and then i added the solr service in the gateway dispatch whitelist services in advanced gateway site
to start there s no space before the date so that immediately doesn t match

it d be better to go for prod fastly d prod fastly d d 6 d the rest is all a json object yes but you should not attempt to parse it so it s type must be a string
the reason for this issue is use of different user in installation and for starting the service
you can define the users as root in hadoop env sh as below hope this helps
port 50070 is related to the hdfs service and it corresponds to the described behaviour because the namenode is not running according to the jps command
most probably you have a configuration issue in the hdfs xml configuration files
to find why the namenode was not able to start please go to the hadoop namenode logs hadoop home logs and trace the error commonly specified in the clause caused by
there is one table called roles which had dublicate for admin role and thus creating the isuue
you need to allocate more ram because right now you don t have enough memory

depends on input file mapper can understand if this data is new and write it with suitable value
so as result of job you will get only new data
since i dont have a hive instance to try out does this work
also check my example lateral view should have an alias u column exploded an alias user if users is of type string then remove square brackets and double quotes then split and explode result
i have solved this problem this is caused by windows authority
in that sense you need to open the port and set the hostname to work
reason is when oozie submits spark job in cluster mode it is not necessary that yarn will allocate the same node local node as an executor
i believe it because fs defaultfs from spark config is hdfs
in my experience there could be many causes for this issue but the first checks you should do are the following your firewall could be blocking some of the ports between the nodes inside your hadoop cluster so the computing never starts
hence by making sure it reads only the files as input this error was gone
you might try broadcasting this map and use the result instead of hashmap
you can try make your variable local or declare one more like this i think this is due to spark serialization mechanism
last but not least having all of services installed in same sandbox i assume single node can cause some of them to throw alerts and errors as the environment is not sufficient to operate everything at the same time
one specific cell contained multiple lines which caused this truncating problem
i believe the java lang illegalaccesserror that you get is because of hadoop common library mismatch you have with the spark installation
the inotifyeventstream is nothing more than the hdfs events log parsed into an object it will send all events in hdfs to you no matter which directory you set at constructor that s one of the reasons why you need to run that code with a supergroup member

https docs delta io latest delta update html merge examples here is an alternate solution have a column updated time timestamp in your table union prev run results and current run results group by node select the latest timestamp save the results
even if you try to loop through schemas still you ll be hitting db multiple times so you can create the query like this and then run this query in spark jdbc
thus i might do this to copy a file cp tmp dist testfile mapr metrics cluster home tdunning tmp dir this has a few subtleties to it
this is great for relatively small files less than several gb because the limited transfer rate for a single process usually less than 2gb s is offset by the vastly faster startup time
the simplest way to make this happen is to use the mapr provided distcp since that comes with everything pre integrated
because hadoop fs commands seem to work it appears that you have a valid mapr installation but it is possible you have distcp from outside that installation
part of that is the code but part of that is due to the fact that simple things like the tab key for file completion depends on the shell having access to files via normal path names
i can t comment on your command syntax very much since i almost never use distcp i use simpler methods but i can say that i have heard of a number of users having difficulty getting it to work as expected
you need to add even empty column qualifier symbol as delimiter between column family and column qualifier into put method also you have a different error message after second run of script because thrift server is already failed

please assign the sparksession builder result to a variable also the reference to the public datasets is bigquery public data so please change the reading to
so the cause of issue was quite trivial it is spark local binaries vs remote spark driver version mismatch
that is because in my case i had not set the hbase rootdir property in hbase conf hbase site xml
before writing to hdfs you can repartition 1 so that you will create 1 file per execution
here it is expecting you to put two values so that it can unpack like user follower data 0 data 1
so that user data 0 and follower data 1
this works like a b x y so that a can have value x and b can have value y
when you initialize counts counter user the result is counter u 1 s 1 e 1 r 1 after line strip data is just a string with no extra white spaces
the problem is caused by dataframe cache
for reasons unknown to me my previous post was against the rules
i was passing a list rather than an rdd into the function which was causing the issue
in this scenario if you are able to run the sql and get the count in minimum time and all your time is consumed just for writing then here are some suggestions since you already know the count of your dataframe remove the count operation as it is unnecessary overhead for your job
now you are partitioning your data based on col1 so better try repartitioning your data so that the least shuffle is performed at the time of writing
you can do something like also you can set the number based on the partition count if you know it
further research revealed this was due to a problem with the hadoop configuration on my local machine
which was causing problem in hadoop 3 solution i have excluded this jar while building fat jar as below issue got resolved
according to the documentation here you can find i don t see the equivalent on static partitions so you may need to query that particular partition and see whether it s empty
because of this config spark yarn keytab home devuser devuser keytab conf

i assumed all traffic would happen through the namenode so only the namenode s ip was allowed through the firewall and into the database server hence i could access them with other clients through there
the problem i had is that some numeric columns were sometimes read as a string because of an na value indicator
in your case you specify the s 32 taskmanager numberoftaskslots parameter without overriding the yarn containers vcores setting thus the app acquires the container with 32 vcores
it skips the first line because the first line are headers and not useful
in the next line it splits by t to extract the title likes tags in that order
it is quite pointless to loop through the iterable since it is done for us in the combiner but it works
but it s better to use packages instead of jars because it will also fetch all necessary dependencies and put everything into the internal cache
it depends on the type of metastore that your cluster is configured to use
so i think that maybe caused by i don t expose my 50010 port
your insert is slow because impala is creating partition for each date replace strleft recorddate 10 in the original table

it will run on for example on worker so you need to have right connections to master yarn from there
it seems that this happens because there are no active executers
this may happen because sometime hadoop starts some services on internal ip address of server instead of localhost or 127 0 0 1
since we are using hive function from utc timestamp we have to use utc based short ids
the solutions are as follows i found the main reason for the abnormality the preliminary judgment is that the rpc has problems so when i execute the sql statement i open the regionserver log of the server where the error is reported i found that regionserver generates the following logs i increased the parameter and solved the problem
finally i discovered that the cause for this error is the attempt to call the spark context object from functions who ran on cores and aren t part of the main script while it was already created in the main script
therefor in order to prevent this issue in case sparkcontext has to be used in a script which isn t the main script it has to be explicitly exported imported from the main script to the side script eg
well the issue was due to hadoop 2 7
that tools jar exists in that location is immaterial it s as if i told you i searched for the book titled can of paint on your bookshelf and i can t find it and you going that s bizarre because pointing at the cans of paint on the shelf in the garage there are cans of paint right here
note that this trivial invocation produces the exact error you are observing and that is the correct behaviour of java because the right way to run it is either java jar c lib tools jar or more likely java cp c lib tools jar
reasons perhaps pig cmd is broken
to be perfectly honest this type of task doesn t seem to need a combiner at all and certainly cannot use a cleanup function for the reducers since it is executed for each one of them
the main issue with your program is that there s no consideration about the operation of the reduce function since the latter is then executed through a number of its instances for each key value or on more simple terms the reduce function is called for every key separately
so the mappers will generate key value pairs were the null value is going to be key for all of them and each value will be a composite value where the district name and a particular tree age are stored like so null district tree age as for the reduce function it only needs to scan every value based on the null key aka all of the pairs and find the max tree age
then the final output key value pair is gonna show the district with the oldest tree and the max tree age like so district with oldest tree max tree age to showcase my tested answer i took some liberties to simplify your program mainly because the french
first since i don t have a look at your input csv file i created mine trees csv stored in a directory named trees that has the following lines in it with columns for districts and a tree s age in my all put in one file for the sake of simplicity program the character is used as a delimiter to separate the data on the composite keys generated by the mappers and the results are stored in a directory named oldest tree
so the result of the program stored in the oldest tree directory as seen through the hadoop hdfs browser is
coursal so this is my mapper and my combiner the goal is i have a csv file
so based on the regex syntax which you can study on your own it s really valuable if you haven t yet the following expression matches all these tokens as we can test as well with the online regex tester here up next for the punctuation symbols we can simply match those by simply looking for characters that are neither letters nor numbers and also not whitespace of course such as the next regular expression does again testing with the online regex tester here after removing the html entities that got matched with the previous regular expression so in order to use those regular expressions we simply can use the replaceall method that based on the regex of the first parameter change all the tokens matching with it to what the second parameter string is
over here we can change all the matched tokens to a simple whitespace and proceed to remove all double spaces in the end so only the valid words remain to be put as key in the key value pairs of the mappers so the program now looks like this and by using the following text file contents as input this is the given output
then it essentially boils down to making a normal method call and processing the result
if it s a social network of even 10k users that means to a particular user most other users are not known thus not useful
i would therefore try to limit the space of users to evaluate based on criteria that fit your social network
what local means in practice depends on your user the idea is to use some optimizations based on the real world
therefore you ll store maybe a couple hundred values for each user
plus you ll want indexes on both user keys since you ll have to search both to find all records for a single user
you can also customize in your streaming how the inputs are going into your mapper http hadoop apache org common docs current streaming html customizing the way to split lines into key 2fvalue pairs data from the map step gets sorted together based on a partioner class against the key of the map
if file is bigger than one block it can either be split so each block of file would go to different mapper or whole file can go to one mapper for example if this file is gzipped
the purpose of a recordreader is 3 fold ensure each k v pair is processed ensure each k v pair is only processed once handle k v pairs which are split across blocks what actually happens in 3 is that the recordreader goes back to the namenode gets the handle of a datanode where the next block lives and then reaches out via rpc to pull in that full block and read the remaining part of that first record up to the record delimiter
jar files are searched based on the classpath variable
also if you are not sure which class is missing you can check the classname hadoop is open source so you can find the class name and then search the class name in findjar
the hbase command line utility can be used for tables access this lets you scan your tables run compactions enable disable tables etc it is like any other database shell but more powerful because as in my next point you can run jruby scripts with the command hbase org jruby main your script you can even run your java stuff while you are in the shell
i dunno about pig but in sql your statement is equivalent to pretty what you ve written it ll be slow too because short of having an optimizer e g
i m answering though because i did have some trouble with the mapper option and solved it by putting the python scripts in the tmp directory
trash api documentation says that trashes in 0 20 are created per user so it s impossible to do as you desired
it really depends on your file sizes
database migration plugin will not be works because it works only with hibernate
there is no point in using ant unless there is a specific reason for using it
the start dfs sh is called by start all sh so it will execute the code to start hdfs which you did not configure
alternatively if you can call context progress or some equivalent function to say that something is happening so that the job doesn t timeout
the problem seems to be caused by assigning references instead of values
since directory are no sequence files they can t be read
i have changed the code like this if fs isfile path fillmatrix result path else filestatus filestatusarray fs liststatus path for filestatus filestatus filestatusarray if filestatus isdir this line is added by me fillmatrix result filestatus getpath in the end of main method fs delete should be commented or the output directory will be immediately deleted each time after a mapreduce job finished
what i d do is change the key so that the timestamp will be descending newer salary first now you can do a simple map job that will scan the table
there is no reason sqoop should only run with cdh and not apache hadoop
my answer is a bit too long for a comment so i m sorry i m not directly answering your question
in my opinion development effort is better spent on building some sort of alerting infrastructure email usually that lets you know as soon as your job has failed instead of accounting for a ton of corner cases
i don t think it s worth your time to account for everything up front
i think there are some issues in having this version work with eclipse
because so much code relies on it and because the new api as you have discovered was never fully implemented they are probably un deprecating the old api in a future version of hadoop
following option may make sense if the amount of work in each mapper is substantial since this strategy does involve overhead of reading up to 20 counters in each map invocation
performance almost certainly for the following reasonsl 1 you will have less memory available for the tasks since vms have theier overhead 2 networking will be slower between vms then within the same os
i also do not see reasons why such cluster will perform better
it depends on your exact configuration but most likely the performance would be slower
they are not as resource hungy as task trackers since they are only sequentially read write data
if you genuinely have no control over the cube object then i m not sure you have many pleasant options i m not sure i understand what you mean by a wrapper or proxy object either way final is final so you d need to create a copy of the class without the final flags you might be able to use a nasty reflection hack to allow you to un final the size field and then set the field value also through reflection but that may cause some undefined behaviour if cube initialised other variables from size in the constructor you could write your own serialization class which will allow you to create a new instance of realcube not the most efficient but it will work for each object rather than utilizing traditional hadoop object reuse is the domain of size relatively small
if so you could create an instance of realcube for each valid size value and again using a custom serialization implementation pick the right cube instance based upon the size read from the input stream
try first starting dfs by start dfs sh then mapreduce by start mapred sh let s see which process actually causes the error
you can not replace data in place since hdfs files are append only and can not be edited
for using a udf on hive you will have to add your udf containing jar to the distributed cache so that it becomes available to all nodes in your hive cluster
the reason is that the fp algorithm does not output subsets of a frequent pattern if its support is not greater
on my cluster this happens on all slaves datanode tasttrackers except for one which results in the general reduce process to first progress very slowly and at a certain point in a reroll of the reduce progress so far due to some error
there is an open major issue in the bugtracker
in my case i hope i can fix it by additional data cleaning and more efficient data structures trove fastutils so the problem doesnt occur at all but honestly this feels kind of like the wrong approach here
not to do those smaller tweaks was the main reason starting with hadoop anyways
shortage of memory also can cause it but disk is more frequent cause imho
the source code is also posted to book s site so you download it there but this is version only for mahout 0 5 p s
depending on the clustering algorithm this directory may be different
try moving the hadoop directory to the root of your drive so something like c hadoop or similar
make sure in your hadoop classpath you have the jar file for org apache tools ant launch antmain you can edit the jar file in hadoop home conf hadoop site file you ll have to restart hadoop for the change to take effect
your command isn t working because to run with jar switch the jar file should have special entry in manifest that describes that class should be started by default p p s
if you re not using the bin hadoop script then the configuration files in conf xml will not be on the classpath and hence any values in them will be ignored
consequently your reduce function and main will be able to work with the same global variable
as a side note i think this global variable should be static since the hadoop framework might create multiple objects for the client map reduce execution
consequently the reducer will modify the global variable of the object residing in the current jvm so the jvm running the client having it s own version of the global variable in an object residing in its jvm won t see the modifications made by the reducer to the global variable
read in the value s of the variable and based on that take a decision
you cannot have a global variable in your map reduce job as razvan mentioned because your code is running on many machines distributed all in parallel
to set a configuration do the following in your main driver function to access the configuration in a mapper or reducer please note that each mapper or reducer will be blind to any changes in that are made to a variable by another mapper or reducer
i don t see the context of your code but based on your exception message it seems that your mapper is a embedded class or so called inner class in simplemapreducepricing
hadoop can not instantiate the mapper without an instance of simplemapreducepricing therefore you should define your mapper class as static
based on the link and my absolute lack of knowledge of hive i think you might want this and i can t test or compile because honestly i had no clue what hive was before you posted your question
your hadoop program will parse query and execute some job to join and read files based on your queries and input parameters
any reason why you can t just use textinputformat s longwritable text input types and performs the extraction and transformation accordingly
if that really isn t acceptable then consider using the chainmapper use one map to do the extraction and then pass those results to another mapperthat s expecting the key values required
you have to use text because you need one value corresponding to your key
the main thing to note is your original import fails because sqoop tries to invoke hive but it s not in your path
the common algorithm if you want to join two datasets on map reduce is to map each dataset to rearrange fields and turn field you want join on to the key of dataset also its useful to mark each record in order to distinguish later during reduce stage from which dataset this record from to concat those datasets into one to reduce the dataset since the key is the field you want join on all you need is perform join on grouped data so if you understand how to join two dataset you can repeat this operation to join with third
so i think you need simply another mr job which will take results of joined a b and join them with c and a bit off i would suggest using hive or pig for it before coding mr in java
if you will have let say 100 answer yes will be obvious in the same time if in addition to data processing in each segment you have some meaningful aggregation of result it will be another plus to use hadoop mapreduce
then since your amount of work is not that large look at in memory implementations of mapreduce
as a general observation the error specified in the op has as underlying cause the fact that hadoop can t find a serializer for a specific type which you re trying to serialize being directly or indirectly e g
hadoop cannot find a serilizer for one of the 2 reasons your type is not serializable i e
your type implements writable but hadoop for one reason or another cannot use the org apache hadoop io serializer writableserialization class
in the core site xml the hadoop tmp dir variable was set to a invalid directory so it couldn t be created when the datanode was started
in class reduce1 you re declaring the output object without initializing it so it s null at this time
it s a ready made setup so that one can spend time in learning hadoop rather than setting up it s prerequisites
assume your pigscript is in dir1 and your pwd is dir2 and since you are executing as user sumod sumod should have write permissions in dir2
the reason for me was that the user i was running pig did not have write permission on hadoop tmp dir
the problem is when you issued your version of the command bash treated as a command separator thus trying to execute two commands first command javah had no classes specified second command was trying to execute export hadoop 1 0 1 folder classes parallelindexation jar but file is not executable
in case of strong quorum requirements you will write to distant datacenter so you write performance will be constrained by link throughput to distant datacenter
and in case of long delays it becomes very likely to have lost writes when client thinks that write not performed but actually it is so it is easy to get situation when you failed to write to quorum but other client will see data considered by you not written data stailness if you will read with quorum 1 for better read performance
if you re using that then that s the reason it fails
this is one of a few reasons why hadoop jobs can have their complete go backwards mappers can even go back from 100 to 100
related to this it s conceivable depending on the stage those reducer jobs are in that they have yet to receive all of the map output that feeds in to them
obviously in that case killing the wrong mapper is deadly
this can actually be a big pain point for non emr hadoop setups as well instead of paying for nodes longer than you need them it presents as having nodes sitting idle when you have work they could be doing along with massive compute time loss due to node failures
as a general rule the tricks to avoid the problem are keep your tasks sizes pretty consistent and in the 1 5 minute range enable speculative execution really crucial in the emr world where node performance is anything but consistent keep replication factors up well above your expected node losses for a given job depending on your node reliability once you cross 400 nodes with day long job runs you start thinking about a replication factor of 4 and use a job scheduler that allows new jobs to kick off while old jobs are still finishing up these days this is usually the default but it was a totally new thing introduced hadoop 0 20 iirc
the underlying cause appears to be an out of memory error as this thread indicates
it delegates this task to outputformat which is responsible for sinking of data
you need to do more than just a javac hdfsexample java in that you need to include some dependency jars on the classpath
something more like javac cp hadoop core 1 0 4 jar hdfsexample java personally i d recommend looking into using a build tool such as maven ant or an ide as this will make things far less painful when you start to organize your code into packages and depend on multiple external libraries
but it seems to me that this video should help http www youtube com watch v kww7bqrykhi feature player embedded after the filtering you can use result in mahout for solving the classification problem
in that action simply copy the file from s3 to a local file using s3cmd or similar
if my memory serves me right the values are sent tab separated and result emitted out from the script is also expected to be tab separated
trying printing stuff from stdout or stderr in your script you will see the result in your jobtracker logs
the pre processor would be ideal if you expect more unorthodox text file formats to come in the future so that pre processor can transform all the different formats into an intermediate format before sending to map reduce
testing mappers reducers which depend on the distributed cache is also tricky with mrunit as 0 9 0 doesn t have support for emulating the distributed cache coming in 1 0 0 if you look at the jira tickets
it looks like you are not using the right contract since you are not extending mapreducebase and not implementing mapper
not sure about exactly what your tcp action is or about hadoop or your proxy setup but if you can reliably repeat the error and the timeout error happens at approximately the same time each time you test and that time is on the order of minutes my guess would be that you ve got a true processing delay perhaps caused by blocking somewhere at the server but not necessarily
in that case i guess you may have to upgrade hive though i m not a hadoop user and don t know the details
as it is written and therefore it is not possible to find preparetwentynewsgroups class
hadoop jobs will typically output their result to a directory with one file per reducer or per mapper if you run a job with no reducers
it could be possible that your wordcount did not process any data and thus you can t see any results
try running bin hadoop jar hadoop examples 1 0 4 jar wordcount user ravi inputall user ravi output followed by bin hadoop dfs ls user ravi output to see the results
if you look at the source for pigstorage setstorelocation you should notice that they store the location in the job configuration 2nd line so i think you should store the location in a job variable which your custom output format can then extract in the createrecordreader method finally and probably the actual cause of the error you re seeing your output format extends textoutputformat and you use the getdefaultworkfile method in your record writer this method needs to know where you are outputting the file to in hdfs and you haven t called fileoutputformat setoutputpath job new path location in your setstorelocation method see the pigstorage setstorelocation method i previously pasted
so the error is because it doesn t know where to create the default work file
here you have so change the root into hadoop curently i don t have access to any linux machine so i can t say exact commands then make yourself sure that hadoop user is able to create filies and directories within var run hadoop
you should find some streaming solution to process large files read data chunk by chunk and save the results w o fixing in memory whole data set this specific task unzip is probably not suited for the mr since there is no logical division of data into records
therefore you got port already in use error
since i was using my single node cluster through a network proxy i had added the following property line to hadoop home conf mapred site xml to by pass proxy server while communicating across hadoop daemons
thus when running hive and sqoop from different directories you might get different table spaces
the master node will be like a supervisor for all the data slave nodes responsible for the get the work done
you don t need quotes around your paths you are missing a semicolon after your registration of the mysql driver so it should look more like this
you get this error because there are some jars missing from the plugin which comes along with the hadoop distribution
if there is a bug then the version of hive you are using would be important to know since bugs are addressed in each release
since hadoop more specifically mr is designed for faster processing of bulk data big data it is apt for your requirement
any specific reason for not using hadoop instance
yes i believe the reading from distributed cache is the reason for your delay
now as for the percentage 66 you see that reduce phase has actually following sub parts copy sort reduce so since your first 2 steps were done and the third one had started but was waiting for the configure to finish distributed cache to be read your reduce percentage was 66
the input path required was the path to the file on the hadoop distributed file system not on the local machine so first i copied the local file to data test txt on hdfs and gave this path as the input parameter
thanks to everyone who tried to solve the problem
this is simply a hack built into the s3 hdfs implementation because s3 doesn t really have a notion of directories so hadoop has nowhere to read directory creation modification date from
the reason why you use something like hadoop is because you cant fit the entire data set into memory
given your clarifications you can t use chainmapper but it is exactly because it does not operate by applying mapper 1 to all keys waiting then applying mapper 2
but you are right that it doesn t cause more data to go across the network here it s not even written to disk
since you need phase 1 to finish you really need to finish the map phase before doing anything else with phase 2
as for the datastructure itself it already is inside of a data structure the iterable so there is no need to add them into a new datastructure
in my case my db oozie was emptly so i drop the db and create it again
i dont know if you could use any other class but you can use two methods for your specific reason startup and cleanup
make sure your classpath is set correctly to include the desired library so that it will be included in the jar
but you re trying to use the old api to set the outputpath i can tell because it takes the old jobconf org apache hadoop mapred jobconf
you get an exception because your regular expression yields one result where two result fields are excepted namely custid and movieids because the regular expression contains just a single group
the issue is because your classpath does not have the mapr jars
don t forget to log out and back in again for the changes to take effect
there can be many reasons
or you can paste the log here so that other guys can help you find out
ensure that this account is checked with username as cyg server can vary depending on what you had entered while ssh localhost
use java version to check which version of java is installed on your machine and change the eclipse preference accordingly
hence on the first day that is at 2009 01 02t08 00z the time given to dataset is 2009 01 01t08 00z which is earlier than the initial instance 2009 01 02t08 00z
you can increase the xcievers count further based on how many threads your application needs in concurrent
after experimenting a bit further the following two steps do what i want this works in my case because there is very little variance in the length of a line
unfortunately for some reason gzip cannot be piped like this so i have to do another step this will then also compress the generated large files
gzip compresses each of these files by a factor of 5 leading to 60mb files and thus satisfying my initial constraint of receiving gz files 64mb
for some reason when both pig and hive are set on the same machine this tends to happen
for some reason when both pig and hive are set on the same machine this tends to happen so all i needed to do is
iterator is not moving ahead because of wrong implementation
i don t know what memory conscious data structure you are using if you give which one then might help but most of in memory data structure utilizes virtual memory means is data structure size increases to some extent based on policy extra data element s will be dump into virtual memory
hence we does not result in out of memory error
issue could be because the hadoop configuration is not properly getting passed to your program
if the mapper and reducer don t use the same output types the mapper key value types must be specified explicitly so you probably need to also add
if your input is like and your want to output you can use cross join to get the results
i guess you don t have gora dependences installed in your hadoop nodes so a solution is to send them using the job instead jar witch has all dependences bundled for hadoop
some possible causes not an exclusive list the hostname of the remote machine is wrong in the configuration files
either your hmaster is not running or the client is not able to contact it because of some reason
it s been a while since i used flume
since data sources are customizable flume can be used to transport massive quantities of event data including but not limited to network traffic data social media generated data email messages and pretty much any data source possible
the files can be rolled close current file and create a new one periodically based on the elapsed time or size of data or number of events
i don t know if your file can be put in that
furthermore there are other conditions involved which i don t recall now that might hamper you from transferring files to hdfs
has the code changed since this run
this would cause the stattype member to be initialized to null
in the task execution environment section the document tells you to use the following they have changed the configuration name so the mapreduce map reduce java opts from hadoop 0 21 0 does not work anymore on the newer hadoop 1 0 3
sort with no options will sort lexically so 2 is before 3 simply because they are treated as strings not numbers
that has the distinct disadvantage that you cannot process a data set which will not fit into memory and a data set which does not fit into physical memory will be extremely slow to handle due to swapping
number of maps is decided based on the choice of iputformatclass
number of maps depends on number of input splits and input format
in mapreduce 2 frame work containers control the resources being used so that you can size resources based on your data estimates and start as many reducers as needed based on data size and reduce function complexity
since doc and docx are binary formats simple text loaders won t work
you can either write the udf to be able to load the files directly into pig or you can do some preprocessing to convert all doc and docx files into txt files so that pig will be loading those txt files instead
pig is not sql so you have to do something like first dump your query into a file and then now this will order these as strings
so depending on the version of pig you re using you ll need to deal with timestamps with the appropriate function
thus reading the whole input data and then trying to deserialize it runs contrary to the mr design paradigm and most likely won t even work with production scale data sets
one possible reason could be that your hmaster is assuming that the rs has the ip of 127 0 0 1 which implies localhost and hence resolves to its own localhost
the idea is that 15 minutes is 900000 milliseconds so that we can group the records into the groups which cover 900000 milliseconds sort them and take the top one
just for the record for anyone curious i had the exact same problem and my solution was to remove the following line defining the combiner function the error seems to have resulted from the mapper attempting to run the reduce class as noted by the reducer run being called within a xxxx m task representing a map task and thereby causing a mismatch failure
but most probably the cause is java net bindexception problem binding to virtual machine cannot assign requested address this signifies that an error occurred while attempting to bind a socket to a local address and port
give you a person s name you don t know it is a man or woman but your friend who is a man has the same name so you think he is a man this is cluster acutually it is a woman maybe we are not sure we just perfer the most likely answer
give you a man you are sure he is near you so you can say he is your neighbour this is classification
all of this is depends on your points thesaurus now i will show you an example of how to vectorize it hmm must be the simplest
now we get the result file1 100 it 0 sport file2 0 it 100 sport file3 100 it 0 sport file4 0 it 100 sport then we can get two group it and sports usually in a file there are lots of words so 100 and 0 not exist in real data don t mind the details just have a think what do this example tell us
permission issue because you gives full read write and execute permission to all user in group for this issue try this command hadoop datanode start if it suggest rollback then execute rollback command then it will give you a permission error go to your dfs location
i have seen that if you introduce an order by clause it after the first group by forces hive into two mr jobs and there by gives the correct results
select t1 symbol max t1 maxts t1 orderts as diff from select catid symbol max cast timestamp as double 1000 as maxts min cast timestamp as double 1000 as orderts count as cnt from cat where recordtype in 0 1 and customerid srcrepid group by symbol catid order by symbol catid t1 where t1 cnt 1 group by t1 symbol but yes this is still only a work around the issue but the real problem is hive uses the wrong partitioning fields in that query it should have just used symbol but if you see the explain on that it uses both symbol and catid which causes it to give multiple results
adding the order by forces hive to do the second group by in a different mr job giving us the right results
the problem is caused by the call to removing this makes it work
i e when you compile the compiler looks in the area with the jars but when you run the program it is looking somewhere else and not finding them hence why your error would only appear at runtime
remember hadoop has native implementations of certain components for performance reasons and for non availability of java implementations

you have to provide your log so we can see the actual message that failed the action
also you need to paste your workflow action so we can see how you ve built it
finally i solved the problem by myself and decide to tell the reason here to help others the reason sounds somehow silly but the problem was this the hadoop daemons were stop
so the reason of this problem is this datanode and namenode and other daemons are not running
it probably works when you run it locally since the lookupservice has no problem with a file in your local fs
based on your comment it looks like you need to specify how the string is to be terminated

if you really want to stick to the old api have a look here what is really important is that you use toolrunner run to start the application my guess is that you didn t since your code is in the main function
since you mentioned the word count example i guessed you were using text

go to pig home bin check with pig help if results are as parameterized
it is currently not possible to create two copies of the file while copying permissions depending on your use case however an option may be to move the files instead
the fact that it is not static means that hadoop cannot create an instance because it doesn t know that it is an inner class of charcount
oozie runs most if not all actions as map reduce jobs so the error message you re seeing is probably because the java action is being executed on one of your compute nodes not the machine from where your submitted your oozie job or the machine where the oozie server is running
i can t speak to your use of javascript since i ve never written a udf with it but in general file access is not done inside of a udf especially if you are trying to access something on hdfs
edit unfortunately acquiring the successful task hostnames isn t available via the client api frustratingly you can do this via the command line but it uses private api calls so you ll still need to perform some string scraping if you were to invoke this command and then parse the stdout and you ll also get the task setup and cleanup events an option could be to use some reflection based hackery to make the private apis publicly visible and then use as needed for reference here s the api calls you need to replicate the above in code and this may not be forward or backwards compatible with different versions of hadoop here s for 1 2 1
if you want to output a dense matrix first of all that won t scale because the rows will be bigger than can fit in memory at some point you will need to enumerate all the rows and columns
the reason for this is that anything in hdfs on an hdinsight cluster is stored on the transient instances that make up that cluster and is essentially temporary storage
you can also use or the powershell equivalent the copyfromlocal command will only work if you have the files on the machine running the command so you could of course download the azure files to that local disk but then why move the data when you can just link the compute cluster to it with the above
instead of copying the code try to clone the repository so that you won t have any error related to file formatting
therefore dns lookups were being passed by the dns server upstream to our dns provider and a dummy ip address returned which then resolved to an opendns not found hostname
i changed the column name to d and it worked fine which is quite unfortunate because the name date is much more meaningful than d
the error you re seeing usually results from etc hosts settings
hadoop local and host destination do not match after installing hive i strongly recommend looking at the hadoop2 setup docs linked below since several things have changed
the language manual si a bit unclear because it only specifies location hdfs path and leaves hdfs path undefined but it can only be an url location path a string
so you should use job class instead of jobconf to configure your job
you should just be able to add a filter stage after the join assuming your start time and survey times are long representing the ms since the epoch
as jerome noted the java udf does indeed return the expected result so long as the table albeit arbitrary has at least one row of data
your method of writing with normal java writer classes will not work just because you need to use hdfs api to write the data
if you edited the file with file browser they might be corrupted because of some non unix new lines
the following xpath should give you the correct result
furthermore some points to improve your query you do not have to use text when comparing node values it will be done automatically and it is quite likely faster you almost always want to use string over text i rewrote the query i think this is much simpler and cleaner because it basically says give me the value node which has a name node with the value first
the second jobs depends on the first one and should thus be executed when the first one finishes
the problem is caused by incompatibilities between hadoop versions jobs build with hadoop 1 may not work on hadoop 2
next you are getting these errors probably because you have not specified hadoop tmp dir property in your core site xml
thus you loose all the hdfs metadata data and have to reformat it
the problem was being caused with the default way sqoop jtds group multiple insert statements into 1 using comma separated list of values
when building datafu i did not find o a lucene analysis tokenatributes offsetattributeimpl in the datafu 1 2 1 snapshot jar lucene s attributesource finds implementations for attribute classes at runtime so it s necessary to package o a lucene analysis tokenatributes offsetattributeimpl in the datafu 1 2 1 snapshot jar in addition to the o a lucene analysis tokenatributes offsetattribute class
i belive that root cause of your problem is that your hadoop distribution is still running on jdk6 and not jdk7 as you believe so
therefore if you execute sqoop on jdk7 it will generate and compile code with this jdk7
therefore if you are getting this unsupported major minr exception while running sqoop on jdk7 is very likely that your hadoop cluster is running on jdk6
but i m only using a vm and in that document is an important clue usr lib64 cmf service common cloudera config sh has a function locate java home which shows that usr java jdk1 6 is preferred before usr java jdk1 7
i fixed my vm by simply changing the search order in that file and rebooting
the actual jar file names will vary based on the hadoop distribution and version you are using
if you wish to trigger a map reduce job from your application make sure you include these jar files and other necessary jar files in your application class path so that when you spawn a map reduce program it automatically picks up the jar files from the application class path
at last i got it it was because of my avast antivirus
since you are writing mapreduce programs i suggest eclipse for which you can find a hadoop plugin
therefore there is a fair chance that the data will be written into contiguous space on disk consisting of multiple blocks next to each other
if that is the entire code then your filterlist will be null resulting in a nullpointerexception when calling filtelist add sick
i would not change them unless you have a good reason
here is some fully functional code to demonstrate how it s done this is a simple left outer join of the two files based on matching id field values even though they re named and positioned differently
i don t personally like talend but it might be worth a look for you since it s free and does do this sort of thing well
i don t like it because you get a barrage of contact from talend trying to sell consultancy services when you download it
you should instead be saying regarding the syntax error near unexpected tokenelse it s not because of any code that you ve shown above
it seems to originate from some other portion of your script
maven copies it in target classes when compiling so it is automatically in the classpath when i run the program
the problem is eclipse setting up your jarfile s dependencies with the rsrc style so that hadoop tries to load rsrc mahout core 0 7 jar but fails because it parses rsrc as the scheme of the hadoop filesystem normally this is implied to be hdfs and then the rest of the string as the relative path within that scheme when in fact rsrc isn t intended to be the hadoop filesystem scheme at all
another possible cause of this issue is having your location wrong for your hive table in case someone else has this issue and can t figure out what is going wrong
it sounds like you want a text file so you should use datastream like this
drivermanager relies on jdbc spec and driver s compliance with it where it s noted that hive s jdbc driver violates the contract and throws exception instead which interpreted by drivermanager as driver understands the url but cannot establish connection for some reason
may be confusion arises because picture is pasted first and its number is pasted at the bottom of picture
for debian for ubuntu of course depends on the version of cloudera that you are planning to use
i think it s because in your serialize de serialize logic for compositekey you write the position as a long but read it as an integer
that will mess up the comparison logic because you re not testing exactly the same thing you wrote to the context
as a consequence it computes the number of trees per mapping task wrong
since there are 2 phase of optimization in hive logical optimization and physical optimization both are rule based optimizations
logical optimization in the logical optimization mapjoin optimization was followed by bucketmapjoin optimization bucketmapjoin optimization take the mapjoin operator tree as input and convert it into bucketmapjoin so a hinted query would be first transformed into a mapjoin and then a bucketmapjoin
therefore hint disabled logical optimisation would do nothing join optimisation on the join tree
however to make the process of dynamic partitioning a bit fast i tried setting few configuration parameters like i am sure you must be using the first two and the last two you can set depending on your data size
even still i think you may have to give pig the sequence t two characters or using a raw string if that doesn t work you ll have to resort to special casing i only read the pig latin expressions reference so this is untested but i d then use a conditional expression and tab as the command line parameter and in python
you can t cast newwordcount since it is not implementing tool interface
do not use these two lines in your code job setmapperclass createpuredeltamapperone class job setmapperclass createpuredeltamappertwo class because you are already passing name of corresponding class in the loop
later i realized the format of splitting input in stand alone and on cluster is happening in different fashion which i am yet to find the reason
the rhinit function is trying to load hadoop jars that are present in directory specified in hadoop home variable since this function only load those jars in hadoop home to the class path you have to keep all hadoop specific jars in that directory itself
since the option of traversing the iterator twice is not possible and your heap cannot handle the large amount of values stored in a list i suggest you add an intermediary mapreduce step giving a total of three mapreduce steps for your job
this is guaranteed thanks to the sort phase
note that only one reducer should be used in this phase so you have to set mapreduce job reduces to 1
it is succeeding on cloudera s sandbox because it is running hadoop 2
it s because you are using the fileinputformat from the old hadoop api with the new one
since you just have to read one hdfs text file line by line you probably do not need to spark streaming for that
in that function you can walk through the lines in the partition store state stuff in a hashmap etc
based on your comments make sure you fully qualify your class name with the package otherwise java will have no idea where to find it
when you run the query without the filter i m guessing you re doing so on the same machine that mongodb is running on so it can connect to localhost 12345
it is because it exists on the c drive of the headnode
now if you used a version that is present in the hadoop test or if you altered the pom files so that hadoop test isn t a dependency
i had this problem as well it turned out it was because of netbeans adding something to my pom xml file
double check nothing was added since previous successful deployments
i chose the third option that i modified a bit because it seemed that fields 6 to infinity which of course is not really infinite didn t insert properly in the last column
for this error set the hadoop configuration file path in oozie site xml file because oozie reads the configuration file from hadoop for yarn site xml after that start the job history server located in hadoop sbin using the below command
i don t have 50 rep to comment so i will write it as an answer
edit according to your comment text vectorstring is a member of vectorwritable class you set this text object in set method so i guess that the set method is also inside vectorwritable and it is not a static method so why do you pass a vectorwritable object to it
because this output vectorwritable 1355b88b looks like you pass vectorwritable as an argument to a method which invokes its default tostring method which would return string like vectorwritable 1355b88b
writable interface is used to serialize objects so you can write the object to an output and read it back but with your implementation it would be hard to parse the string you create and read the object back
it also reqires to add the following property to mapred site xml on the windows box so that the job launcher knows that the job runner will be a linux and mapreduce is running fine now
further clarification from the comments indicate that the op might be better served using a streaming model in which incoming data is processed in micro batches this is an example of how an urgent event count streaming job could look like not tested for illustrative purposes onle based on the network wordcountexample as you can see if you need to connect to a database all you need to do is to provide the necessary driver and code to execute the db interaction
hadoop is having trouble understanding 2014 01 01 05 05 20 664592 08 as a timestamp because of the 592 08 at the end
there are no test cases so i m not sure if it s actually working though
backing up meta is a bad idea because once you ll restore it you ll end up with the layout of the tables not matching the layout described in meta causing the system to not work
avro supports versioning so you could have different records with different sets of columns depending upon the underlying version and the the version of the schema used in the table definition
in this case you may check if the namenode is started correctly on the master by checking logs at your yourhadoopfolder logs hadoop hadoop user namenode master log it is often caused by the hdfs is not formatted before
its efficiency stems from the fact that the files are only copied once per job and the ability to cache archives which are un archived on the slaves
create an internal table base table for the first time load create an external table incremental table for the incremental updated records join the base table incremental table based on primary key and max date and create a view on top of it
your second requirement is something which hive doesnt support that is to update the already loaded entries so here s my 2 cents if it helps you
there are issues in the regex that you are using in your gsub
you will risk losing your hdfs contents when tmp is cleaned which could happen any time update based on op comments
though the solution is trivial i would like to post here so that others novice hadoopers might benefit
the reason is because datanodes and tasktrackers threads are processed on different nodes of the cluster in my case i had one ubuntu box as master and two ubuntu boxes as datanodes
about first hql it should have from clause its missing so hql failure regarding second hql from table should have atleast one row so it can set the constant init values into your newly created table
since i think user username directory doesn t exist in your case hence you get the error you are specifically telling it to list root directory which it does successfully as it exist
error is actually caused by this message caused by java lang classnotfoundexception org cloudera htrace trace probably you are missing a jar in the classpath
the reason might be that the id of the user running the job cannot be less than 1000
the line application application 1404208879507 0002 failed 2 times due to am container for shows that the tez application master likely failed to launch
this could be due to various reasons
the simplest place to look for the reason is the application logs obtained by invoking bin yarn logs applicationid application 1404208879507 0002
the most common issue causing this is usually some setup configuration error leading to classnotfound errors when launching the java process
according to this line it might cause by your name node can not access your data node with root accout via ssh
based on what i found we cannot have mapper output send to two reducers
the reducer can select the task based on some key criteria
since sqoop breaks down export process into multiple transactions it is possible that a failed export job may result in partial data being committed to the database
this can further lead to subsequent jobs failing due to insert collisions in some cases or lead to duplicated data in others
this is possibly because you re using the old map reduce sequence file class
it depends on your map reduce program and what classes it uses my gut feeling is that is does not work
hadoop 1 x x to 2 x x is major release change so there will be major changes in the classes and the libraries that you use in your program
hadoop 2 x native libraies so shared objects are compiled with 32 bit jvm so it gives the error as you got
or you need to add access key and secrete key in your path depends on how your script expects them
start all this again and look for the results
since you have to save every byte of data that is in the file in memory except possibly the delimiters start with looking at the size of the file and comparing it to the size of memory
i think the problem maybe due to the configuration or the fact that you need to specify the other parameters also
the problem here is that can t download the corpus 20newsgroups with the curl command because it doesn t find in the operating system look at the following line error bin classify 20newsgroups sh line 68 curl command not found
i have been writing mr which loaded data from local filesystem into hbase in old version of hadoop hadoop 1 i do not remember which version and now i had to rewrite it because the hadoop libraries are completly different currently using cdh5 0 1
it could be due to limited permission on folder on worker node where you are copying file
thanks to keyser the ast literal eval method worked for me
aside from the change in keys from test randomwrite bytes per map and test randomwriter maps per host to mapreduce randomwriter bytespermap and mapreduce randomwriter mapsperhost causing the settings to not get through to randomwriter the core of the problem as indicated by the filenames you listed under data sorted data is that your sorted data consists of map outputs whereas correctly sorted output only comes from reduce outputs essentially your sort command is only performing the map portion of the sort and never performing the merge in a subsequent reduce stage
because of this your testmapredsort command is correctly reporting that the sort did not work
when it is called from the frontend before the job is launched then you ll get filenotfoundexception because at this point the files from the distributed cache are not yet copied to the nodes local disk
basically your namenode is listening on the localhost interface therefore it allows connections only from 127 0 0 1
however since it s downloading a quite small shell script there might be a networking issue with that url it wgets
and the leaseexpirederror was actually thrown because of little ol me when i was killing the processes
it has been mentioned in that tutorial please fire the below command in hadoop installation directory
in initialize i need something similar to returnoiresolver update arguments 0 shown in the first answer so that return returnoiresolver get will have something to return the objectinspector for the return value
if you have not defined so by default it gets created in tmp hadoop username hadoop user so you need to remove this directory
http www cloudera com content cloudera en resources library recordedwebinar introduction to yarn and mapreduce 2 slides html so if we submit large no of queries in hue hive editor for execution they will be submitted as jobs concurrently and application masters for them will be allocated resources leaving no space for task containers and thus all jobs will be in pending state
solution is as mentioned above by romain set the value of max no of concurrent jobs accordingly to the size and capability of cluster
pig supports globbing so you can do the following so all that s left to do is read the file that contains those file names concatenate them into a glob such as and pass that as a parameter to pig so your script would start with and your pig call would look like this
in myinputformat override getsplits method first read the actual file name s from the some temporary file you have to get this file name from configuration s mapred input dir property then update the same configuration mapred input dir with retrieved file names then return result from wrapped up inputformat e g
but this would not happen because if store and load use same file in the script pig ensures that the jobs are executed in the right sequence
well i found that while installing hadoop rpm from hdp 2 1 repository the libexec folder was not copied in hadoop hdfs folder in usr lib hadoop hdfs so i exported the path of libexec which was residing in usr lib hadoop libexec in my bashrc file and it works fine now
i suggest you first try to get it working with a single server cluster so it s easier to debug
the invocationtargetexception has probably wrappered the actual causal exception so you need to somehow catch the runtimeexception at the top level then e getcause getcause printstacktrace to find out why the invocation of the configure method failed
this is causing the cast exception
i think there are some differences between terminals in linux and windows thus in windows you need to add quotation marks to clarify this is a value string otherwise might not be recognized
there is nothing about search and it s optimization in hadoop stack so you may choose either vanilla or cloudera for you project
secondly the sqoop does the export by using insert statement so it is relatively slow
thirdly since i notice you try to export to mysql you can try batch mode which runs the insert query in this way insert into table values row1 row2 etc
thirdly since i notice you try to export to mysql you can try batch mode which runs the insert query in this way insert into table values row1 row2 etc so you can change your command to sqoop export d sqoop export records per statement 1000 connect jdbc mysql localhost database username root password mypwd table tablename direct export dir user hduser oozieproject workflow output batch
you will need to compile all java files as below javac classpath usr local hadoop hadoop core 1 2 1 jar d compiled classes driver java mapper java reducer java please note that your classpath value may change slightly depending on how you install hadoop
in that case you can pass their types to the constructor
i think it s still a bug since ssh is supposed to be optional
a java long is a signed 64 bit integer so it can fit fit 63 bits worth of number
the reason for this is that the two interceptors you ve configured are writing the values to flume event headers which get serialized to the body by the headerandbodytexteventserializer
in that case you would just need to specify the path to your class in and drop the jar in flume s class path
correct signatures of these methods are due to improper override your methods map reduce don t even get called
depends on your hadoop version
the solution is if you use this above solution hadoop will run properly but you cannot view the older files as because hadoop lost these information about these files once you formatted
after mapping all three lines we get the following list of key value pairs group by key the above key value pairs are sorted by key and we get and then all values having the same key are grouped into a list which can be done efficiently since they re sorted by key combine reduce the combiner and the reducer in this case do the same thing so let s assume that there is no combiner at first
obviously each nosql vendor would claim itself to be the best but much depends on your use case
regarding hbase it depends on your requirements whether it would be a good solution or not
since you are looking for longer term persistent store you should consider a database that provides you horizontal scale so that you could add more nodes as and when you would like to increase the capacity
when your storage is a few tera bytes you may have to worry about the database scale throughput so that your infra cost doesn t bogg you down
you may not want to index everything but fine tune what you index so that you could query on the keys and or only those data elements from within your records so that index storage overhead doesn t become too much and hence you keep the cost under control
hence for inbuilt pig functions we do not need fully qualified name to be used
you can then store the result however you want
please use this java code for word counting with two arguments one is input file other one is result file
sqoop and sqoop2 have binary distributions that differ based on hadoop version
some time network also one of the reason
this is due to incompatible cluster id problems so format your datanode directory and start again
since your cluster is a tens of nodes it is fine to have a single node with namenode and jobtracker
coming to your question it could be the configuration file copying causing conflits same problem answered here and you can try copying the working datanode configuration with the appropriate changes
this will not cause any data deletion as you would have set replication factor to more than 1
finally i looked for that big decimal high value in the hive metastore scripts and i saw it in every hive schema 0 1 0 mysql sql in the following create statements when i checked in the hive metastore database for those tables i got something different so since both tables were empty i just dropped and created them again with the create statements listed in the hive schema 0 13 0 mysql sql file
i created the directory bin hdfs dfs mkdir user root and the problem got solved as i was logged in as the root in ubuntu
earlier i was giving wrong username hence facing the issue
it s not there upstream too https github com apache hadoop tree trunk hadoop common project hadoop common src main java org apache hadoop io serializer avro but this is because it s a generated class
the definition is here https github com apache hadoop blob trunk hadoop common project hadoop common src test avro avrorecord avsc https github com cloudera hadoop common blob cdh5 2 5 0 5 2 1 hadoop common project hadoop common src test avro avrorecord avsc you re not finding it presumably because it s a test class too not included in any distribution
this is a non relational db so it is easily possible that this key doesn t have a value for this column
in that case getvalue method will return null
string constructor that accepts byte as an input can t handle null values so it will throw a nullpointerexception
my guess is that one of the later files one you haven t run through manually is causing the problem
because of single coats oozie take it as a single string
even if so you can pull your to be the first declared dependency in pom xml so that the latest jar is picked up by the classpath
the symbol that could not be resolved per your stack trace appears to come from there at least based on cursory inspection only
twitter api has some restrictions on streaming time and typically it is determined by your ip address
make sure you can reach the data nodes telnet port so that the communication issue can be discarded from the equation
this exception can occur due to several reasons
the possible reasons can be
that will give you the exact reason for this error
set the replication factor in case it is 1 the default is 3 to take advantage of data locality data is copied to more nodes so some data transfering can be saved
a mapper probably accepts its input on stdin and writes the result to its stdout e g blah py usage
this is likely due to using java 8 rather than java 7
it only allocates based on memory requirements
a single node may run more than one service i e it can run a namenode and datanode although in a production setup it is not done since we don t want the machine that is running namenode service to be overburdened
since you are using hadoop 2 6 you might also want to have a look at the yarn architecture to understand how jobs are getting executed have a look at this
since my solution is targeted for hive this works perfectly
this was happening because i was changing the the mapred input dir on the fly to point to a particular file on hdfs
this is going to be thrift jar accumulo start jar accumulo core jar and possibly accumulo trace jar depending on your version
your where clause references line id which is ambiguous because it could either be from dt1 or dt2
you will need to change it to either dt1 line id or dt2 line id depending on which you intended to refer to
you should consider reviewing your code to see what s causing that resource leak
usually it s caused by instances where the gc is not able to remove the data from your memory
that is the reason why your the script is not able to find the exact file you want to run the pig script on
the reason is you didn t assign the output relation
since hive doesn t support row level inserts and updates there are few workarounds
a sample now if you have if my understanding is correct you are using a context initialized on the driver whereas with it depends on the caller it might also be created in the executors
coherency model in hadoop definative guide says after creating a file it is visible in the filesystem namespace as expected however any content written to the file is not guaranteed to be visible even if the stream is flushed so the file appears to have a length of zero once more than a block s worth of data has been written the first block will be visible to new readers
through my freaking out i m stressed because i m on a pretty tight deadline i had over looked some pretty fundamental information
or if you re looking for tools jar for java 8 then it will be in ok so i ve found tools jar but now i need to know where to put because java isn t seeing it
this will transparently rename the classes within your jar so that they do not clash with different versions of the same classes that are otherwise put on the classpath by oozie or hadoop
take care that since based on size of input data no
of files there may be many mappers running in parallel so the file name would have to be unique
with the accumulator it would look more like python is not my usual language so it might be off by a little
as the hdfs dfs ls output shows your replication factor is set to 1 so there is no compelling reason for hdfs to distribute the data blocks on the datanodes
but since im working as bi dev this is my next level
the error exception in thread main java lang noclassdeffounderror org apache hadoop hbase hbaseconfiguration is due to lack of hbase jar
from what i can think of you have the following options 1 using hipi hadoop image processing interface which provides many tools for image processing 2 using 3rd party image input formats like imageinputformat 3 using 3rd party wholefileinputformat to read one whole image at a time but it will be read as a whole file so you will need to parse it
still depending on your images there might be some need for parsing
if that doesn t work try making the compareto method take object as an argument instead of middle for the first cannot find symbol this occurs because there is no field called value in the object
i suspect that this should be this number instead of this value similar thing for the second cannot find symbol error the final error is due to the fact that your middle class is defined as a non static nested class inner class
add it to your pom and configure accordingly have a look at my example below
the reason is you are passing bag datatype ie affaires debut as input to the todate function but todate function will accept only chararray or byterarray as input
concat can only be used inside a relation aka foreach statement so you cannot use it to construct an output file location
alternatively use something like oozie to schedule your pig jobs and have oozie generate your output location based on date time
eventually i guess the reason why namenode replys datanode location as sandbox hortonworks com is because the vm set its hostname as sandbox hortonworks com so you can change the hostname back to localhost to resolve this problem completely
i had a similar issue in my case now it s working below is the conf file i hope this can help you
since you have used a tail command with f only changed data within the file will be dumped into hdfs
as it grows it needs to copy itself into a larger and larger buffer so you end up with buffers of length 16 32 48 64 not sure about the growth amount but you get the picture
anyway a large number of values passed into the reducer can cause a lot of memory to be used and garbage collection can handle most of that until the stringbuffer gets so large that it can t grow
method 1 in the driver class you can call it accordingly
powershell is interpreting 0 as a parameter and since it is not defined powershell is substituting an empty string
this class makes calls on os level so you can start any process with this and they are completely separate from the java process that started them
the exception you re seeing is most likely caused by classpath issues missing library version mismatch between the driver and workers
you need to be sure that this won t result in a security compromise
setcaching is used to tell the server how many rows to load before returning the result to the client setbatch is used to limit the number of columns returned in each call if you have a very wide table setmaxresultsize is used to limit the number of results returned to the client typically with you don t set the maxresultsize in a mapreduce job
this is because the string split method interprets its input as a regex
this is due to the fact that the backslash itself must be escaped
so in your case it will creates an array with 340000 elements which will result in a java heap error you may want to take a small sample of your data and collect it or you may want to save it directly to your disk
here s a snippet of how to do that you won t have the nice getters and setters of course since java doesn t know know what type it is
you ll have to cast the result to the type that you know the field to be
if you don t know you ll have to have instanceof checks for every possibility since java is statically compiled this is also why it s not as helpful as you might at first think that you have access to the schema
it s throwing nosuchmethodexception because it can t find a no args constructor
based on the following lines from your code when you set the input format to textinputformat the map key is always longwritable value as text
this could be because of the mix and match of the apis
so assuming the print statements are placeholders for different actions depending on the size of lword
another improvement you can make is to take advantage of the fact that comparisons in python can be chained so that for example also since you re going to be testing len lword more than once it makes sense to store it in a variable rather than calculate it over and over again finally since it looks like you re doing something similar with lword whatever its length you carry out that action after you ve done your tests
i d highly recommend finding a way to upgrade to the latest version of impala as there are many bug fixes since 1 4
by this way all your customer s xml files will be composed within a mapfile which eliminates the small file problem so that your namenode may breath easily
if your problem has input data that s a single record that can grow arbitrarily large and cannot be broken up mapreduce is fundamentally the wrong conceptual approach because you re not doing any decomposition
depending on your file format you can create an inputformat if necessary so that it knows how to split the file up
potentially this will result in rather large records so you may want to tune your block size to be around the average size of your records for better distribution

you may also find that spark better suits your needs since it has better iterative computation since it keeps more in memory
have you changed all the configurations file in slave machine so instead of localhost now must say the master s hostname
you should seek for the words localhost and stuff like that in all your files on your hadoop home directory because there are several files for configurating all sort of things and it s very easy to forget some
something like this sudo grep ril localhost usr local hadoop etc hadoop check the same as before but in master so instead of saying localhost it says the hostname of it
sometimes that entry so typical of the hadoop tutorials could lead to some problems in masters and in slaves slave host it should say only slave and in your master host in masters file it should say master and in your slave file it should say slave
when we place a large file into hdfs it chopped up into 64 mb chunks based on default configuration of blocks suppose you have a file of 1gb and you want to place that file in hdfs then there will be 1gb 64mb 16 split blocks and these block will be distribute across the datanodes
data splitting happens based on file offsets the goal of splitting of file is parallel processing and fail over of data
these blocks chunk will reside on a different datanode based on your cluster configuration every block get assigned a block id and namenode keep the information of the blocks for every file
answer to your question there is no other way to control data replacement policy on hadoop but if you divide your file based upon hdfs block size say block size is 64mb and your data size is 63mb then one file will occupy one block and it will go on a specific datanode but again datanode will be chosen by namenode
but placing small file on hadoop is not a efficient way to deal with hadoop because hadoop is designed to deal with very large datasets and small file can be overhead of namenode
looking at the error my guess would be you need a clean build package assembly since it isn t even able to find the fileareadyexists exception
you can also use maven so that once you give basic dependencies it will fetch all the other dependencies required
fyi vmware player provides a dedicated ip to the sandbox and their guest os therefore all hadoop services is accessible through the guest os ip address not through your local host
it was very useful since the name of the variables has changed between the various versions of mapreduce
starting 17 09 that fills up the old generation until it causes some failures at 17 15
you can also ssh into the system using password would be hadoop in that case
as the error explicitly tells you your path is invalid since it contains the symbol used to separate individual file paths in a list of file paths
so if your logging system writes in stdout you will be in trouble since it will very likely break your logic and your job
one way to log is to write in stderr thus you will see your logs in errors logs
so it won t work with your input table because the line is not a valid json
i m going to assume that the 12 is month and that 3 is day since you didn t specify
also you said you want hh mm ss but there is no seconds in your example so i don t know how you re going to get them in there
ok i fond the solution d thanks to http apache spark developers list 1001551 n3 nabble com fwd unable to read write avro rdd on cluster td10893 html
the foreach keyword is not used to create a loop it is used to transform your data based on your columns applying udfs to it
therefore the only way your code could work is by grouping the data first however this won t work because inside a nested foreach you cannot refer to a different relation like data2
you are using gradle 1 4 and the tutorial claims to have been tested with gradle 1 12 so you could simply try to upgrade gradle to 1 12 if possible
because the ip that the client received for the datanode is an internal ip and not the public ip
because the ip that the client received for the datanode is an internal ip and not the public ip
it depends on the way you want your date to be retrieved
this is the reason for using invalid user even getting the ticket for any other user using kinit command
this is because few of the properties in your config file are not set correctly including below two properties
i did manage to partially repro your case after manually configuring intra network ssh during startup i actually see the following as expected simply by calling org apache spark scheduler cluster yarnclientschedulerbackend start it tries to contact google cloud storage and fails because there s not gcs access without external ips
to get around this you can simply use f hdfs when creating your cluster to use hdfs as your default filesystem in that case everything should work intra cluster even without external ip addresses
in that mode you can still even continue to use gcs whenever you have external ip addresses assigned by specifying full gs bucket object paths as your hadoop arguments
however note that in that case as long as you ve removed the external ip addresses you won t be able to use gcs unless you also configure a proxy server and funnal all data through your proxy the gcs configs for that is fs gs proxy address
in general there s no need to worry about security just because of having external ip addresses unless you ve opened up new permissive rules in your default network firewall rules in google compute engine
hbase is better suited for low latency and random reads so it may be a better option for you
be careful pigstorage will automatically split your data if it finds any delimiter so row may be only first element of each row
your date 2015 02 22 is a string so the to date should not be doing anything
my results are below results in 2015 03 19 results in 2015 03 19 results in 2015 03 19 you will need to leave more information for someone to help you troubleshoot further
based on the answer from the community this question can be solved by following two jira topic
you will need to track down the cause of zookeepers failure look for the zookeeper log files
in that case you d need
currently we use salt because of the push pull abilities
i use maven so i added the maven shade plugin artifact and use the default scope compile for the dependencies
after looking your code i suggest below tweaks preference should be based on simplicity using resultsetextractor public list student liststudents string sql select from student list student students jdbctemplateobject query sql new resultsetextractor student override public student extractdata resultset rs throws sqlexception dataaccessexception student student new student if rs next student setid rs getint id student setname rs getstring name student setage rs getint age return student else return null return students using list keep it simple list student students jdbctemplateobject queryforlist sql student class
replace this section of your code with the below note change the metastore dbname user and password accordingly as per your setup
the number of mappers and reducers is dependent on if the job is parallelizable and the capacity of your cluster
because the correct formatted json with no data would be like this type null coordinates null which should be picked up by serde and parse accordingly
its a good usecase resulting due to lack of understanding of different layers
but when you write a signature like this you re telling hadoop that the key and the value type for the input are email and nullwritable hence the exception
if it is running the following command returns some result
the usage of static variables is not encouraged for the same reason you mentioned
the behavior is surely different based on the mode in which hadoop is running
this is due to sqoop being compiled on hadoop 1 x you can download sqoop compiled on hadoop 2 x on the sqoop site goto link releases sqoop 1 should look something like this sqoop 1 4 5 bin __ hadoop 1 0 0 tar gz sqoop 1 4 5 bin __ hadoop 2 0 4 alpha tar gz get the sqoop or hadoop2 x should solve the problem
issue could be due to versions
issue can be due to sqoop sqoop2
or in general due to different versions of sqoop and haddop
the task gets assigned mappers and reducers based on the input
the error you re getting is because the root user does not have permissions to write to user
problems were caused by lack of some libraries
i ll post a list with all libraries which i inserted in nutch lib folder this way isn t best one because nutch isn t correctly installed on the cluster yet
the nm must keep the list of all blocks in memory and is 150 bytes per block so you run against the physical limit of your nm ram
by using sys path append you don t have to manually change the hadoop sh file and cause conflicts with other java configuration files
if the fat jar local location is available in local nodes and the classpath need to be updated with the same local location and hadoop need to be restart to take the effect then start the oozie job and check job console the required jar should be reflecting there
that s because the pig command line does a lot of things among which setting up silently the appropriate pig jars in the classpath before invoking the pigmain java class
but oozie calls the java class directly the classpath issues are supposed to be handled either by the pig sharelib when active or by you as a knowledgeable java developer after all it s your choice not to use the default way to run pig so you know what you are doing right
the results could prove useful
let me know if you haveing any other option so that same i can use for mine case
what i suspect is happening is the type elephant bird jsonloader uses is miss interpreted by hbasestorage but it does understand the pigstorage type and thus allows it to load the data into hbase
the final issue turned out to be the timeout set by us was less so it was throwing the exception
setting the proper timeout resolved the issue in hiveoptions calltimeout
i dont have any idea to get all the columns which tweet consists i think you should use storage formats which stores metadata internally like avro and update schema accordingly so that you can support dynamic schema
so that the cluster can access the container
once you copy to hive date as a string type you can use below query to get a result in original format
hbase doesn t have a protocol to tell all the regions to update the schema changes online so we need to disable the table before alter it
i e drop the table so we must disable all operations except a few operations like list is enabled is disabled etc on the table before dropping it
it s something you must put into your head so that it becomes a reflex all resources required by an oozie action scripts libraries config files whatever must be available in hdfs beforehand downloaded at execution time thanks to file instructions in the oozie script accessed as local files in the current working dir in your case then
there is a background process thread which sorts your data and writes the data to different partitions depending on the number of reducers
try compressing your intermediate map output and set your compression codec depending on your file size
hdfs runs on the concept of write once and read many times so you cannot overwrite a output directory
but you can t select it what s more when output ls result to file and use vim to read it shows like following what is m it s a carriage return cr
sed 5q d means read the first 5 line and quit delete former lines so it selects 5th line
the reason is that in the original foreach to generate ulogurls i did not cast to double properly
the analytics for hadoop service was upgraded to biginsights v4 about a month ago this is why you see a different ui to what is on some of the online tutorials as those are based on the previous biginsights v3
i have kept hive hbase handler 1 2 1 jar hive serde 1 2 1 jar in the auxlib path which was causing the problem
i just needed to join on the result of the flatmapping
the input to the reducer is key and list of values which is in your case list of data so you can store them very easily as per your requirement
reason is a safemode for namenode is essentially a read only mode for the hdfs cluster where it does not allow any modifications to filesystem or blocks
i figured out that i am mixing yarn and mapreduce apis and that is causing class loading problems
hence the submit call fails
as a result each mapper will fetch 200 rows
since you were able to perform put and get it should not be a jar issue
not a hadoop expert but in theory could have a hadoop project inject the results directly into sphinx the outputcommitter
rather or in addition to writing the results to hdfs
each small file will incur in overhead because the block size usually 64mb is much bigger
i want to do it myself so i m thinking of solutions
and therefore when we try to fetch the next token from the string tokenizer and set it in val part it throws an error
because the table is split up by the hashes of the id s the size of each split is based on the values in your table
this happens because hive passes some internal columns to help the reducer phase which is not the part of the data when hive optimize sort dynamic partition is enabled
the error occurs due to the rc file stripe buffers going oom due to too many record writers open simultaneously
make input not splittable so only one mapper runs and one mapper output since you are reading hbase this might not be a good option to have a single mapper do the entire work
in fact oozie doesn t recognize the wildcard you need to pass the full acl with the following format user1 user2 user3 also it seems that the format user1 user2 group1 group2 like presented in the bug oozie 228 doesn t work because oozie split the acl string based on character
thanks to cloudera they provide a way to boot services on system startup
to use your local python files with hadoop streaming you need to use the streaming jar its location depends on your installation see this post here
the purpose of view is to hide complex query from user let say you did some complex join query to get all sales data now you want your end user to fire query like select from sales to get all sales data so in that case you can go for view
since you are working on hotronworks distribution it makes more sense for you to use ambari instead
if you have a hostname not like localhost you ll not to be able to deploy a pseudo mode for dfs because dns won t give you ip address from your request domain name
ie key1 value1 key1 value1 here the mistake was using the same reducer class as a combiner since the above said rule is not satisfied
in theory build a pig job to run the count and dump the result to stdout as if it was a java property e g
my count 12345 in oozie define a pig action with capture output flag to run that job then define a decision based on the value for key my count using the appropriate el function in practise well have fun
this issue occurs because of an apache httpcomponents version conflict between the s3 conenctor and the google bigquery hadoop connector
all my answers are merely general opinions and might drastically change depending on data flavors of operations to be performed
also question implies data and results of such operations are mission critical i assumed so
no such file or directory error means that you haven t made your home directory yet so you re trying to ls on a folder that doesn t exist
ensure it has the correct permissions which i guess depends on what specifically you want to do re groups etc
i got the following result
my 2 cents experiment with an orc table with gzip compression default and clever partitioning ordering every select that uses a partition key in its where clause will do partition pruning and thus avoid to scan everything ok ok you said you had no good candidate in your specific case but in general it can be done so i had to mention it first then within each orc file in scope the min max counters will be checked for stripe pruning limiting the i o further with clever partitioning clever ordering of the data at insert time using the most frequent filters the pruning can be quite efficient
hive does not understand msg format so you will have to read it as a string and then write a query on it to read from the blob store and then insert it into the table
when using jdbc this job is done by the hive server so the jar has to be stored in that path but on the hive server which may not be the same machine you re using to run your program
the exception is coming because hadoop is not able to find a file system implementation for the scheme sftp
since options are usually job scoped there is little granular control over individual outputs
try invoking the command in the command line and post the result
because u r using arg0 2 and arg0 3 also in your program which is third and forth argument respectively
this in turn results in the error
so when i tried the same rhive query with supplying the username and password i was able to achieve the desired results
this is happening because the key type is not the same in the class declaration and the function argument
since the types are not the same your map function implementation does not override the default implementation
opentsdb is used for analytics data in your case like this location timestamp number of cars seen in that location
or if you want a query like to get last 10 locations of a particular vehicle you can make your column key as long max value timestamp so they will be ordered when you select a row vehicleid you can just get first 10 result in scan results then close result object
this rowkey structure provides you to get last data points easy and ordered column data structure is not so important depends on how you want to write your code
kylin ships a jar file specified by kylin job jar property in kylin properties so first i made a fat jar file with missing dependency set path of this file in kylin job jar and ran the job again
the newly added dependencies had some dependencies which were not available on all nodes hence the job failed again
same result newly added dependencies had some more dependencies which were not available on all nodes
since these jar files are used every time i run a cube job i coppied all these jar files to all the nodes under hadoop home share hadoop common hive metastore 0 14 0 jar
the problem is the following piece of code in ifile java in the append function there is a check since you are passing null as the value the nullpointerexception is thrown when it tries to getclass on a null value so even if you use nullwritable which is again a class and pass null you will still get the nullpointerexception
in my case i was using vmware so it had installed two network adapters so all i had to do was to enable them
it looks like that you have shifted index by one should be substring 15 17 instead of substring 16 18 but i can t figure out why based on the input file snipped maybe you missed something here
due to the shifted index you receive months 12 13 11 instead of 01 01 01
and you receive 0 as max temperature due to shifted index tmax isn t presented at the beginning of the string
you don t need tmax part in the reducer so you can only produce intwitable intwritable month temperature as mapper output
it s been a while since i worked with nutch but from memory there is a time to live on fetching a page
finally after several hours r d i fond the problem was because of a bug in nutch which is like the batch id passed to generatorjob by option argument batchid id is ignored and a generated batch id is used to mark the current batch
listed here as an issue https issues apache org jira browse nutch 2143 special thanks to andrew butkus
when i run the following test script including your two create hbase table statements i ran this example through both jsqsh and the db2 command line i get these results i get the following results
note that maven doesn t know about sources or javadoc they are just classifier for the same library and version so it is not necessarily true that they will always be there but most probably they will
if you want to get the sources from maven without browsing and downloading them manually you can check another so question and answer on the topic
thanks to zeppelin community for the quick action
for testing purposes disable mem checks for yarn scheduler minimum allocation mb you might go even lower because actual reserved mem is used in incremental steps
the reason is that hive metastore uris property is not set in hive site xml
for me it s just because some files in share hadoop yarn folder is missing which was caused by an incomplete download of hadoop tar gz that can still be abstracted by command line
one cause behind this problem might be a user defined hdfs dir environment variable
in my case using sudo helped but for the wrong reasons there was no problem with the permissions but with the environment variables
one of the reasons is the flume event is little more complex it has concept of headers and body
log file indicated that the process threw a non bind ioexception due to the desired port being already taken
too bad you are stuck with hive 0 13 because once the log dispatch is activated server side you can retrieve these log entries from your java code either asynchronously or en masse when execution is over with something like that stuff is not really documented but there s the source code for hivestatement that shows several non jdbc standard methods such as getquerylog and hasmorelogs also getyarnatsguid for hive 2 and other stuff for hive 3
i think there are still some issues in hive insert update delete functionality is hive 1 2 1
but alas after 60 minutes the namenode just sees that the lease has expired without any sign of the sqoop client being alive so it closes the file or rather makes as if it was never created no flush has ever occured
hence when the number of reducers is set to 0 it doesn t actually mean it should give the correct result as all the mappers data is not covered by the combiners
stefan thanks for answer in my utility i never connect to hive datastore or database i parse hive queries using hive exec dependency and extract source and target table so there is no question of checking whether table exists or not anyway i solved this issue by upgrading hive exec dependency to 1 2 1 and the query i posted working fine with hive exec 1 2 1 version
this might be problem due to frequent namenode format
the localhost will try and resolve this hostname based on the local dns setup
i suspect this is because the outputschema field chararray decorator specifies the name alias and datatype by default of the udf
when you call it twice you re using the same alias twice in the generate and so the duplicate schema alias field error results
e g something along these lines hex foreach data generate convert hextostr name as field1 convert hextostr age as field2 then each result will have its own alias and that error should go away
without re aliasing there wouldn t be a way for pig to differentiate which result you were referring to elsewhere in the generate statement
reponse to comment from op i suspect you could replace field in the decorator with whatever specific string you d like but you would still have the issue of calling it twice on two different fields using the same alias so you would still need to re alias
max value casted foreach max value generate 0 as maxval int finally we can issue the filter query to get the results
the reason behind such behavior was hdfs
in flume logs one can see below warning message too to remove this problem one can opt for any of below solution up the data node to achieve required replication of blocks or set property hdfs minblockreplicas accordingly
initially my localhost was set at 9000 which i think was already occupied for some reason
on doing twice in same session you will face this error the second time you register the folder error 2999 unexpected internal error this is because the pig compiler doesn t understand two things a jars dependency resolution
this has the advantage as there are scenarios when your jars need to be imported in certain order because of dependency resolution issue
for ex twitter elephant bird project for working with json data has several jars dependencies so you need to import them in the correct order in pig else you will always face such exceptions
copy from the comments if somebody else runs into this issue based on the log line the problem is not in the hdfs but in the local filesystem
hence you need to adapt the rights to write on the node
your code is almost perfect for mapr and your dependencies are ok as you probably know mapr does not use have for many good reasons the concept of namenodes
the following code will work mapr knows how to connect based on the information you have in the opt mapr conf mapr clusters conf
it fails doing this and thus it cannot continue and connect to hbase master
if you follow install docs you will deal with zookeeper as well https hbase apache org book html standalone dist my personal advice use 1 1 3 instead of 1 2 0 unless you really need 1 2 0 for some reason
you have to start cloudera manager and start zookeeper yarn and hdfs in that order
it looks like your data aren t guaranteed to have trailing zeros so you would have to check the string for a decimal point split on the decimal point if it exists and so on
but for good reason hive doesn t want to start removing dirs in hdfs
thus you will not have duplicates
because your cluster will have a corresponding replica on other datanode
hadoop cluster i e namenode datanodes and other service are setup by hadoop admin based on size of data
using csvexcelstorage will solve this as this storage can deal with escaping thus creating the right amount and sequence of columns
this is because your driver isn t present in the uber jar that you are submitting to the cluster whether it s a standalone cluster or yarn or mesos etc
solution 1 since you are using maven you can use the assembly plugin to build your uber jar with all the needed dependencies
if i explicitly install the maven assembly plugin on the eclipse i am able to create a fat jar with the dependency jars included and hence the program runs
with col1 datatype as array string why is this behaviour because hive not able to detect the values inside array as integers as we are having 1 2 values enclosed in accessing col1 elements or with col1 datatype as array int type if you are thinking to don t want to change the datatype then you need to keep your input file as below without square brackets for array i e col1 values
after being stuck this took a while so adding here for future reference the following fixed the problem
either add to pom xml note version could vary set accordingly or add to your classpath so that the hadoop hdfs client jar gets included at runtime
the data that is already in your table is going to trash because this exactly what overwrite means
as you are sure about id column existence it could be an issue due to case sensitivity
seems like failed to create directory usr hdp 2 5 0 0 1245 spark work was the root cause
these type of conditions are usually caused by permission issues on linux file paths or logs etc
basically the reason why it works is quoted from here
it would be nice to see what caused the nodemanager to stop
also the open file limit may be low based on the ulimit a in the output it is set to 1024
i haven t used oozie for a couple months and did not keep archives because of legal reasons and anyway it was v4 x so it s a bit of guesswork upload your valid hive site xml to hdfs somewhere tell oozie to inject all these properties in the launcher configuration before running the hive class so that it inherits them all with job xml some hdfs path hive site xml job xml remove any reference to oozie hive defaults warning all that assumes that your sandbox cluster has a persistent metastore i e
from your console attempt to create a folder without php like so i m guessing that this will fail since the data node is down
for some reason the it did not format right the first two times i tried it
to run embedded pig we need to set hadoop home property so that pig come to know which version of hadoop you are using by default it will take hadoop 0 20 version
extremely sorry for the silly mistake but thought of putting it as it might help someone has to be replaced with instead of overriding reduce method i wrote reducer hence it was not called
hadoop consists of a lot of components but they re generally not as decoupled as they should be which is one of the main reasons cdh hdp and other hadoop distributions bundle only certain versions known to work together and if you have commercial support with them but change the version of something they generally won t support you because things tend to break when you do this
1 5 or 1 6 then you also need a newer version of hadoop be it cdh hdp or another one as spark has evolved so quickly and yarn support was bolted on later so there are loads of bugs and issues in earlier versions of both hadoop and spark
it says caused by java io ioexception createprocess error 2 the system cannot find the file specified looks like your input file pigtest txt is not present in hdfs
create the requested directory before writing the file into it and also change the permission so it is not too open for private data
i know the reason
for example a common reason for error is that in your do something function you have a for loop that contains continue statement with certain conditions
hadoop waits for too long without seeing anything so the task is considered failed
but i think that is considered setup time because it is before the first line of output
i found this error happen because of yarn configure
by doing you are trying to do a variable substitution thus your error
configureincrementalload sets the reducer class to putsort or keyvaluesort according to output values so if i want to use a custom reducer class i have to set it after configureincrementalload
just answering my own question so it may help people who run into same problem
this is because those ec2 servers cannot reach your laptop via ip 10 0 0 130 which is always provided by your isp you can log into your ec2 machine and ping the ip it will not work
since you didn t provide any useful information on cluster specs data volumes and your query my guess it that either your query is not well written or you lack the cluster resources to timely finish your request
the only issue with the larger number of partitions is the time before the query starts running i suppose it because of receiving partitions metadata from metastore
this was due to slaves file moved from windows to unix without doing file format conversion
because the stream is managed by rollingsink it cannot be closed in a class implementing writer
in that folder you must be having a file name success if you are not having this file in that folder it means your job was unsuccessful
localhost 8080 belongs to name node so if you are using version older then hadoop 2 x then you might face such problem so it will be better you check your job status from 50070 hope this answer your question
if not please share your detailed log so that i can be more specific
i would first look into the hpl sql approach so it can be run as any hive query then i would attempt it with spark if the first approach didn t work out
based on your query i tried to create a dummy table on my system and generate the result
now my architecture is as follows thin mapper simply reads the input parameters and emits key value fat reducers read the files and execute algorithm with received key then emit results set d mapreduce job reduces 10 to change the parallelization level it was silly mistaken approach but the correct one was not obvious either
most probably it happens because it tries to call tostring on your job before it is submitted
i think the issue could be because of the scope
the error was due to running the mapreduce program locally in the machine i changed it to run in yarn and the code works fine for all the type of datas
edit summary of my understanding of the issue you are facing 1 total hdfs free size is 5 32 gb 2 hdfs free size on each node is 2 6gb note you have bad blocks 4 blocks with corrupt replicas the following q a mentions similar issues hadoop put command throws could only be replicated to 0 nodes instead of 1 in that case running jps showed that the datanode are down
when encountering issues where only the first run works it always resulted in issues revolving the checkpoint data
you must be executing your command with os user mapred who has only read permission on the file directory you should try with hdfs user since it hase read write access you can also chmod of file directory for other users if you have sudo root privilege on the hdfs node
as mentioned a few times you can get a lot more specific in the structure you can also add more tables in there to make the relationships and therefore the data integrity much more robust and better scale able
struggling for about weeks something clicked in my mind i e i was using two reducers in my job so defining two jobconf for each my earlier wrong code jobconf conf new jobconf getconf test project class jobconf conf2 new jobconf getconf as i thought that configuration is already defined so didn t mention class test project class in conf2 my present correct code jobconf conf new jobconf getconf test project class jobconf conf2 new jobconf getconf test project class the error was thrown because on execution it was searching for test project twodarraywritables as it has no test project class class it can not locate twodarraywritables now it works fine
also you can define a name of your udf at top of the script so that you don t have to provide complete udf name each time
it s probably because you didn t config your datanode maybe your namenode either or there is something wrong with your configuration file
this may possibly be because sqoop cannot find the hsqldb which it uses to store job information
based on your link we re talking about 18gb that s doable
usually these errors are due to permission errors mis configuration
first put the file to local fs since source only operates on local disk
i believe the behaviour is because of the following two lines there is only one job job3 although you have mentioned that there are two mappers look at the mapper types
the latter of the two configurations multipleinputs or tablemapreduceutil overwrites the previous one in the job3 and hence only a single mapper executes ps please let me know if this is incorrect i am yet to validate my understanding i have presented here on my machine
i m not sure where you grabbed your dependencies from but your code is looking for some cloudera package that doesn t exist thus the error
i just downloaded hbase with brew install hbase and the correct class file is org apache htrace trace located in usr local cellar hbase htrace core jar so i would recommend downloading the latest version of the hbase libraries
i faced the same issue in the past when i was beggining with storm
i think there is a lot of exception in reduce function so framework can not complete the job properly add try catch to get exceptions in reduce function
since you mention that your nodes are vms i would guess you overloaded the hypervisor or it had troubling talking from the nn to the jn and zk quorum
in my case this issue was caused due to the difference in the system time between the nodes of the cluster
i guess line number 18 is this one occurenceinfile put val new intwritable occurence get 1 so it is possible that occurence variable value which is read on previous line is null
so it is hard to suggest what can cause it exactly but you should debug your program and find why can occurenceinfile get val return null value
the mapper is get assigned based on number of blocks or your input split
use combinefileinputformat to combine your input files into a single split so that one mapper will process your data
in that case you need to extend combinefileinputformat and implement the getrecordreader method by return combinefilerecordreader
you should try to include camus api you can find on this linkedin s previous generation kafka to hdfs pipeline page since the missing class is contained in this package as you can see here
the error happened because of the two different versions of python
with hadoop 2 it yarn is the default scheduler which manages resource containers so it is mandatory to have yarn
in that case you ll need to install hadoop mapreduce v1
so the hadoop log dir default is empty the start dfs sh use the default directory setting by hadoop env sh i use hdfs use to preform the start dfs sh the hadoop log dir set to hdfs so it will not have privilege to create directory
they have changed mapper from interface to class because if you are implementing an interface then there is a restriction that you have to implement all functions of that interface otherwise it will throw error
unfortunately bdutil does not use the same vm images as dataproc and as a result changing deployed software versions isn t as simple as changing a image version flag
therefore i created a schema manually and added it as an argument when loading the csv file
note that there is no need to set the windows line endings the the result by any method executed on the dataset
thanks to the help of yaron we could figure out how to load the csv with inferschema
therefore the deployment of the base services will fail
since you have not specified the schema in the load statement you will have to refer the columns using order in which they occur year seems to be the first column so try this
basically java jar start jar downloads the jar files so it is not doing indexing here but downloading the solr 4 8 jars and then configuring it i replaced solr 4 8 with solr 5 2 1 due to performance and now solr working fine
since there is space in file name it self
because in another common case when a small file has only 1 block each replication is a complete file
couchdb doesn t have properties which are necessary for distributed transactions so it s impossible
unfortunately couchdb is an ap solution in the cap theorem sense so it can t even guarantee record level consistency
of cause you can disable replication to make couchdb consistent but then you ll lose fault tolerance
as mentionned distributed transactions are not possible this notion doesn t even exist because it is not necessary
you need to rethink your data structures and make them document oriented because if you don t you are off the intended usage of couchdb and as you know this is risky territory
for datanode replication error following may be the reasons make sure the connectivity between namenode and datanode s and also the datanode s have sufficient space to store the new blocks
in that case it will look for files in local file system
you can either remove the second line because it is overriding the first but making them one line is recommended
it had been changed due to some reason and i just cross checked hostname etc hostname file reverted it to the earlier name and just restarted my machine with init 6 reboot command didn t work for me and the issue was resolved
then you need to submit feed based on that cluter
this is because you have not called any api
from the source authmechanism is case sensitive so you ll need it to be kerberos
might require a copy constructor since i had one for vertexdistancewritable but never checked that out
modify your job xml above the configuration and there no need to upgrade to xml 0 2 to xml 0 4 directly exit 0 4 because in oozie site xml we have xsd file for that the error your getting because of job xml should be place above the configuration
you can change accordingly
i used a host only adapter hence no port forwarding was required
i haven t tested re indexing the same collection since i usually re index into a new collection and then switch an alias but it should work alright
because if you use the above idea you ll have one file one day stored in one machine but the next day of the month data might be put under a different data node
if you are interested in selecting only limited set of data like the case you have suggested then it s better to go with some abstraction like hive and creating a partition based on month
one of the reason can be below dir doesn t exist as shown in logs
assuming your code does not give an error i can think of 3 potential problems here your regex is not called your regex in pig is not returning the expected result the output of your regex is not shown to deal with the situation i would recommend the following steps create a pig program that succesfully uses regex to find b in aba create a pig program that succesfully finds both occurrences of a in aba create a pig program that succesfully finds the firstof a in aba keep growing this solution gradually untill you reach your actual solution if you still get stuck please share the last solution that worked and the first one that didn t work
if you re new to hadoop better start with a book some introduction i can t recommend one since i haven t read any
i can t tell you where those logs are because it depends on the your distribution version and on how it was configured
i suspect one vital service does not start probably hdfs looks like namenode is down and this causes every other service to fail
if you would do describe on your projections like that would help you to understand the data structure and plan your processing accordingly
you probably need to add a mapping for it in your hosts file so it can be resolved
may be program is running but in the end since you are deleting output directory you are not able to see any output
it depends on hive server2 authentication property value in hive site xml embedded mode sasl authentication if hive server2 authentication sasl then start beeline like below nosasl authentication hive server2 authentication nosasl http mode hive server2 authentication http just go to the property and start beeline depends on above value it will started without errors hope this really helpful for you
at this point you can collect results from the output directory you can start pooling the output directory in hdfs after starting the mapreduce job
read all files in output dire process and show results on webpage shahzad
each user having its own bashrc file so you have to set hadoop home and java home in hduser bashrc file once you login to hduser please set hadoop home java home bin path
as a result the following error occurs when starting the application with openjdk
this question is very vague if you think the last query produces the proper result note that it is not the same as the first one
some data processing actions are a good fit because they are embarrassingly parallel
some data processing actions are a bad fit because they cannot be distributed
the simplest way for hive to do that would be to run the where clause in parallel 451 mappers on 451 file blocks then dump all partial results in a single sink 1 reducer that lets the first 200k rows to pass through and ignore the rest
bottom line you have a very inefficient sampler and the result will probably have a strong bias smaller file blocks will be mapped faster and processed earlier by the reducer hence larger file blocks have almost no chance to be represented in the sample
i guess you know how many records match the where clause so you would be better off with some kind of random sampling that retrieves approx
however according to your error it should be due to incorrect query
i cannot help you with hdfs throughput but since you mention a middle layer i ll list some of the commonly used datastores in conjunction with spark that generally offer high writes i think you re trying to use spark as well
set one or more to non zero values determine when flume considers the file complete so that it can close it and open the next
as usual you will need to experiment and learn based on your data and infrastructure
however if there are logical issues because of distributed processing that might not be caught here
so if you wish to estimate the time taken for certain amount of data which depends on processing power the virtual cores available to the resourcemanager and the memory also managed by the resourcemanager you should be looking at the yarn statistics given in second image
however if you only are running it on your computer then there is no point to you using mapreduce since you re cluster would be virtual so you d be gaining no performance improvement
your job didnt produce any results so the files are probably empty
add hive lib path to classpath in spark home conf spark env sh restart the spark cluster for everything to take effect
in my hql i use insert overwrite directory hql out path to overwrite the output but it seems to be unstable which result in repeat items thus i clean the output path before the hql and the result turn out tobe right now
you should probably use org apache hadoop mapreduce lib output multipleoutputs instead of org apache hadoop mapred lib multipleoutputs in general you want to make sure all of your imports are of one type so either mapred or mapreduce
run jps to check and check the log to find the reason why it is down
thus writing to that folder as the horton user will not work
the location flume env sh is dependent on how you installed it
one of the issue in command is wrong specification of logger
the directory structure of your project must match the package structure so the source file enhancedtopn java should be in a directory samples topn enhanced and you must compile and run it from the base directory of the package structure going into the directory and using java enhancedtopn will not work and will give you the error that you are asking about see lesson packages in oracle s java tutorials
configuring yarn in a hadoop cluster it s vital to balance the usage of ram cpu and disk so that processing is not constrained by any one of these cluster resources
we want to allow for a maximum of 20 containers and thus need 40 gb total ram 20 of containers 2 gb minimum per container in yarn site xml yarn will allocate containers with ram amounts greater than the yarn scheduler minimum allocation mb
the compiler is then confused since the class definition is ambiguous
this is because hdfs creates some data on the first run but stopping it can clean up its state so mapreduce jobs can be ran through yarn afterwards
druid supports two ways of ingesting batch data hadoop index task index task the spec you are referring to is of a hadoop index task hence type is index hadoop and also ioconfig type is hadoop
this incorrect for two different reasons you take hash of a column object not values in the dataframe you use incorrect equality operator
hadoop command should know which class to execute which is pass right after jar argument usage hadoop jar jar mainclass args see manual so you should run jar as job configuration looks good
set number of reducer to previous step result in mapreduce driver each file per reducer
so i had to deactivate the safe mode of the name node with and import the file with so that i could finally run without getting any errors
the building throws a lot of warnings but i don t think it s because of my workaround as the warnings are mostly about stuff being deprecated
since the job is to read the input file and write select content from the input files to a output location in parallel this is a mapper only job
the partition key dt in the source table is returned in the result set as though it were a regular field so you have the extra column
i finally found out the cause
this is probably not the only way but i am quite confident that it will work because i have seen 2 vms in a cluster before
note hadoop does not try to recover data from broken nodes but simply replicates the relevant blocks based on non broken nodes
there are several possible causes for this
ok so i found a fix i moved the files from the directories i e from to by doing and now it works the problem was that union in hive created a partition between the tables and hence created additional directories to save the files
a straight forward and simple mapreduce program would best fit your scenario here is the code for your reference the below program will perform 2 operations at a time 1 collect row data and convert to key value pairs 2 eliminate the duplicates and store only distinct values to output since the key is the combination of the initial token value token hence duplicates will be eliminated b reducer
based on the input provided in the question i am assuming your delimiter to be and the format to be text this will create a table on top you data
this example do extract the parameter starts with dfs from all the hadoop xml conf files located under the directory input and write the result into the directory output implicitly created by hadoop as part of execution
i tried this step several time and after checking the tables i understood the tables are populated with sample data but because of a problem in shell the process stops in number 17
hence there are different configuration parameters for mapper mapreduce map memory mb and reducer mapreduce reduce memory mb
most probably its not there because thats error said that so put it in to that directory and restart manager
as was alluded to in the comments the issue arises because my isp s dns resolvers have a redirection service that redirects an unknown host to a sponsored page
to remove this error you have to execute following commands on your hive shell reasons for this error by default the hive exec dynamic partition configuration property is set to false and hive exec dynamic partition mode is set to strict because hive versions 0 9 0 could not perform dynamic partition
this is probably an issue because you are not the super user
your hive table sqoop import departments null is pre created and not with fields terminated by and lines terminated by n check create table script using i think your field delimiter is causing issue here
the org apache hadoop mapred invalidinputexception error mean that spark can not create rdd because the folder hdfs user artist data txt has no file on it
since oozie hive action is running in the cluster and not on the edge node all supporting files needs to be in hdfs path
upload the file to hdfs path so that it is accessible from any node in the cluster
this was causing the error and as i fired 100 mapping jobs it has processed the data successfully
you will still need to manage your allocations so that you have enough memory for your data but your application s heap won t grow with this data and your application itself will not throw the out of memory exception or hit the max heap limit unless the application is evil
it depends on what operating system your hadoop distribution is installed
i met this issue in cdh6 3 0
in my case i didn t intend to write an object to the sequence file so the fix for me was just fixing that bug
if first command run perfectly last command won t work because last command block work like a catch block
so when the code readjson fails in first command block it throw an exception and last command catch block handles it so it don t try sink current data in kafka topic because it will run droprecord
you havent provided more info about what you are doing so lets think about what happens when you would scale orders of magnitude the task
join everything onto these starters by user and product filter out things that are in the wrong order starter after row remaining are group to find the maximum valid starter for each row remaining will be now join to reattach the relevant dimensions now you can get the results by grouping on the starter id
the quorumpeermain service is visible with sudo jps command because you are running the zookeeper with sudo home hduser zookeeper bin zkserver sh
you should run the zookeeper without sudo in command then it will be visible in jps command result
so that it would be helpful for others
this appears to be a duplicate of this question how to see contents of hive orc files in linux the hive orcfiledump location of orc file or something similar depending on your hive version should do it
this is because your map reduce does not gets correct queue for the job to submit check the queue where you submit the job if you are using cluster then it must be getting the in the default queue this you can see in the yarn ui
this was causing the issue
since dt is the partition column it should be last
you are using operator so not sure if dt is last or not
this will cause solr to cache hdfs index file portions in heap so it is important you check what is the size of your jvm
by default phd will set this parameter to 1 hour in the core site xml which can cause out of memory errors on hiveserver2
you cannot compare results for two clusters
the results may vary on number of mappers on a node replication factor network etc
cluster specification would depend on what are you trying to use it for
each mapper would work on a single file so there would be 15 map tasks
about the error since you are using dynamic partitioning on join1 did you set correctly the max number of partition which can be created
this table is partitioned by day so that accessing any day requires only access the corresponding partition and not the whole file
only if join is made at map stage thanks to bucketing the difference is visible
then try is anything working issues like yours depends on lack of env var
simple select queries works fine the reason is they won t trigger map reduce jobs in background
why it does not start depends on how you made the jar
based on this block report information namenode will build the above mapping in fsimage
its mandatory to initialize the schema with schema tool comand hive home bin schematool dbtype mysql initschema note in my case dbtype is mysql since i use mysql as rdbms
seems like the creation of the kryo serializer falls into that category since you didn t actually do anything with your newly created sparkcontext spark didn t bother creating the serializer
we found that current version of elephant bird 4 14 is depend on protobuf version 2 6 0
this is because using a storagehandler has too many negative effects when dealing with the native hdfs filesystem
the conf folder is used by flume to pull jre and logging properties from you can fix the error message by using the conf argument as noted the warning about a1 is because you have a probably typo near the end of your agent configuration file a1 sinks h1 hdfs filetype datastream which should read agent1 sinks h1 hdfs filetype datastream as for the files you haven t configured a deserializer for the spooldir source and the default is line so you re getting an hdfs file for each line in the files in your spooldir
try to move one file and see what are the result
i think you are getting this error since you are using kite sdk 1 1 0 version
it may be happening due to the duplicate keys
the error was correct in that c users user downloads does not exist on the hdp sandbox because it s a linux machine
as noted you can also try and use the ambari hdfs file viewer but i still standby by note that scp is the official way because not all hadoop systems have ambari or at least the hdfs file view for ambari
the twitter streaming api has been experiencing problems since the attack on dyn the 21st of october
as of yet there is not a clear answer for what the cause of the problem is but the observed behaviour is that connections to any of twitter s streaming endpoints get closed after short periods of time normally although not always without receiving any data
sometimes the connection gets closed whilst sending the response resulting in invalid json
you map operation is resulting in some error and that propogates to the driver which results in task failure
sqoop makes jdbc connection with rdbms and perform range queries depending upon number of mappers
thanks to the comments i ve managed to resolve the issue
thanks to all for your answers
this error is due to lack of write privileges to home for yarn user
the error you getting because add jar command expect fully qualified path of a jar
sqoop2 runs by a script as a first argument or runs in interactive mode based on the source of sqoopshell class checked it on grepcode
update after yours after checking the source code at the exception pretty much one thing can be null at that point the connection object which means the getconnection call earlier in this method got a null as a result which by further checking the code could not happen that means an sqlexception was thrown while trying to make the connection and it stays hidden because of the npe in the catch
especially because you are using p option and still got the warning about it in the output
modify below regex based on number of columnns
i d rewrite the above code something like this because we are accessing elements in string array with checking the existence
for the second line nothing exists after so the line element would be only one element long and only have a string in line 0
when you try and access line 1 you are fetting the arrayindexoutofboundsexception because it does not exist
amar it s due to permission issue please run the below commands sudo chmod r 777 home user hadoop fs chmod g w user hive warehouse
use chown r hduser hduser xxxxxxxxx hive or whatever username usergroup you are using to grant owner hence full permission incl write create i dont know whether there is a default hive user group named hive hive i created this but granting the ownership right to this hive user created wont work basically the installation instruction assumes you the hadoop and hence hive who inherit your right have sufficient permissions
linux tends to be flexible in many things so cause some chaos
thus running msck repair table your table name should solve your problem
found the root cause of the issue sqoop task is inserting around 4 million records into teradata and hence the task is bit long running the insert query since long running is going into teradata delay qeueue workload management at teradata end set by dbas and hence sqoop mapreduce task is not getting a response fro 600 sec s from teradata since default task time out is 600sec the transaction was aborted by map task resulting in task failure ref http apps teradata com tdmo v08n04 tech2tech techsupport roadrules aspx solution 1 increase taks time out at mapreduce end
based on your screenshot it would be 1
i m dealing with the same problem and i found the execution error thrown by hive is caused by a timestamp field of string type which could not be parsed
i m wondering whether timestamp fields of string type could be properly mapped to es and if not this could be the root cause
hive deals with the missing parameter on file by filling it with a null value on the query result
it seems that the issue of hadoop trying to read non existent files stems from the inputsplit
especially it depends on what algorithms you use in analytics the real time behaviour do your customer expect show result in seconds vs show results every 24h the reliability requirements can you afford to loose some results in case of server failures the data amounts how many tps also on a per device level
depending on your answers you might want to have a look a t cep engines complex event processing as a basis for your ae analytical engine
this is causing the python subprocess to tell you that it cannot find xgboost binary as the paths are not the same
the problem in the question was caused by a failed build of xgboost
after that i started to have the following error what 19 15 47 src io s3 filesys cc 779 check failed curl easy perform curl curle ok aborted core dumped this last error comes from the fact that the s3 bucket didn t have a valid ssl certificate so i modified the s3 filesys cc source replacing all the https with http
it s because while creating table i gave separate fields by
it s because while creating table i gave separate fields by so what i was trying to insert as a string into the table hive was interpreting it as different columns
this is not due memory or limitation of reducer but its due to the way you are doing computation it will be good if you define your join computation using map reduce instead of doing all the computation inside a single reducer if you run the same computation in standalone code you will see the same issue please go through this link to understand how you can do joins in mapreduce
so you cannot simply echo directly onto hadoop fs you need to use the hadoop fs put function in order to put it there
really handy you can directly hadoop fs put onto hdfs file system so you could do all the sed awk etc and then put it onto hdfs
also depending on your hadoop version you might also have the path in your site xml files such as hdfs site xml core site xml yarn site xml mapred site xml and a few others depending on what services you have
therefore the sink which was faster take over all the entries and only some of the entries were passed to the hdfs sink
based on your answers to my comment here is how i think it should be done if you are implementing it using plain map reduce create a custom inputformat that reads the excel spreadsheet
one cause behind this problem might be a user defined hdfs dir environment variable
you didn t tell if your installation was based on ambari or normal manual yarn install so i assume it was a latter manual
the build failure is due to the issue of the break support of cmake version 3 7 1 for microsoft windows sdk for windows 7 i used cmake 3 6 3 win64 x64 and the build success view the screenshot i post the issue 16483 at 3 7 1 broke support for microsoft windows sdk for windows 7 the cmake issue is planeed to be resolved in cmake version 3 7 2 i used the following software tools apache maven 3 3 9 cmake 3 6 3 win64 x64 cygwin64 jdk1 7 0 79 protoc 2 5 0 win32
or note i am assuming you are using data fu since pig does not have a median function ensure the jar is correctly registered
actually the safest and fastest way is to use double max value for the max and double max value for the min since you donot need to get the iterator twice
you have windows carriage return in your file r n in that case use table lines terminated by r n
firstly i believe mapreducebase is a deprecated class so you are learning outdated methods
now that should theoretically run quicker than the biggest key because you ll have many reducers for each output key
the output collect method of the reducer class is responsible for that
root cause may be there are other hive jobs are using the same table names
by looking your log file messages you are missing two things using org apache flume source twitter twittersource class in your configuration so flume sources 1 0 snapshot jar must be present in your flume lib directory
since you are creating external table in hive so you have to follow the below sets of commands these commands work for me hoping it helps you
for the numeric fields based on the range and precision you can use int or decimal
batching is a client side buffer without any limits so it can cause huge thrift requests when it is sent
hence closing this thread
technically if you have reduce you re turing complete so you could run anything in a mapreduce cluster
this will give only files and folders under tmp grep v this removes the directories from the output since we only want files gawk print 2 1 this prints the file size 2 followed by the file name 1 sort n this does a numeric sort on the file size and the last file in the list should be the file with the largest size you can pipe the output to tail 1 to get the largest file
that s because you use the option h of the du command and the h option will format file sizes in a human readable fashion e g 64 0m instead of 67108864
you say nothing about inserting if the row does not already exist so i don t see upsert as being appropriate
so i try a lot of things and i ended up with the followings select results select header pcode from products ok select header pcode from products ok select header pcode from products ko select header pcode from products ko select results select header pcode from products ko select header pcode from products ko select header pcode from products ko select header pcode from products ko avoid uppercase in struct fieldnames with tables stored as parquet in cdh 5 9 0 it worked in cdh 5 8 2
if you want to emit only 6 reducers and if you want to distribute the data based on the year then based on the data characteristic it will happen that some reducer will have 20gb while some will have only 15mb to process
either you can find another attribute like year and other attribute or you have to increase the reducer count and have to define partitioner based on attribute s hashcode again in that case also it might happen few reducer will get more data for processing
please check the logs of the nodes or if possible paste here so that we can look at it
the error which you got is because sqoop isn t able to find the required dependency org apache hive hcatalog which is available in hcatalog of hive
i assume you would like to post an array to the key field k and a different value to the value field v so you could create an javapairrdd and save that to elasticsearch something like the below
it is not possible because cloudera will warn that spark or hue nodes will lost ping for your network latency
since the local linux user of hdfs cannot enter home mohammed the command throws a no such file or directory error and exits as a result of being unable to locate or read the provided file
because as a part of sqoop import to hive data is temporarily copied onto hdfs under user cloudera before moving to hive warehouse location
the error is thrown because the variable hadoop conf dir used in the command is not set in the environment and is trying to start namenode with no actual config config hadoop conf dir path
could be useful for someone so updating the answer here hadoop server installed was kerberos enabled server
could be useful for someone so updating the answer here hadoop server installed was kerberos enabled server so we installed mit kerberos on tableau server and enabled token
depending on your compaction strategy you ll pay either in space or in iops for having that
added changes are propagated through the sstable hierarchies resulting in a lot more writes than the original change
i think the same sql will get the same result
select from table name this query simply scan the entire table and dump the output on screen therefore you see the different log output on console
while select count from table name just scan the hive meta information and put the result from their itself
hive describe formatted table name table parameters in hadoop aggregation conditional arithmetical operations etc required a processing engine to process and execute the result and therefore whenever you submit this type of job it internally get translated into a mapreduce program the mapreduce program gets executed on behalf of the query and produce its result to hive and hive display on your screen and therefore you see a different result
turns out it was because i had iterated over the data set twice the line int df iterables size values tricked me
the iterator hadn t reset hence the main block of reduce didnt run and finally i hit a null pointer because i tried accessing my data that hadn t even initialised
i actually didn t use the apache drill so please update in comment if it works fine
according to this hortonworks community portal link the steps to amend your data node directory are as follows i m assuming that you re technically already up to step 2 since you ve displayed your correctly configured core site xml files in the original question
if you are just trying to order the data this is all you need i think your issue is related to trying to get this into this in that case referencing splitting a tuple into multiple tuples in pig in apache pig how can i serialise columns into rows
i was able to resolve this i was not able to get the output in rows because the was part of parent array i updated my query and used the nested explod i got the desired output enddeviceeventdetailsname enddeviceeventdetailsvalue eventsequencenumber 683 eventsequencenumber 684 eventsequencenumber 685 eventsequencenumber 686
since the custom loader was being loaded after all of my configuration changes it overrode the configurations that would have let me group splits
to view the contents in that file give command hadoop dfs cat latlog part m 00000 which prints all the data in latlog table
you are using instead of probably it is because you are telling hive that your data is stored as parquet
looks like you are missing the relation jnr mas ins all where is this coming from jnr mas ins will be emtpy since there is no relation jnr mas ins all it should be ins master all
the simple solution for it is to remove the slf4j jar file from folder in hive due to which this multiple jar error is appearing
now there are multiple slf4j jar file so in your error log check which slf4j jar is causing error most probably it will be slf4j log4j12 or something like that
it actually depend on your hive and hadoop version
this error occur because the same jar is present in hadoop lib folder which contains all the jar related to hadoop and also in hive lib folder
now when we install hive after hadoop the jar which is common is again added as it is also present in hadoop lib folder thus it is required to be removed from hive lib folder as hive will automatically detect this jar from hadoop lib folder due to its dependency on hadoop
thus it is safe to remove it from hive lib folder
this example data can be found from there so you can load it to spark shell with relative path scala spark read format libsvm load data mllib sample lda libsvm data txt
below are complex datatype supported by hive arrays maps structs union you can create struct depending upon your datatype need
hence was getting the error
dynamoddb client is not serializable entity because it contains things like handlers thread pools etc
therefore it should be initialized straight inside job and declared as lazy val
root cause analysis there is a limitation of only 1 mapper in use
this could be because the service doesn t support splitting or the data is small enough that the job won t benefit from splitting background datameer uses salesforce connector which intern uses rest api calls that can fetch a maximum of 2000 records in a single request
rest api calls are synchronous and have a limit of 5 seconds under which they return results
since this is an identity mapper pass through which would match up with the error you re seeing
for obvious reasons i haven t tested it for your specific requirements so it could need some more tuning which is often the case with these sqoop commands
in my experience importing as parquet forces you to use the query option since it doesn t allow you to use schema table as table
as mentioned in https dcosjira atlassian net browse dcos 586 the cause of the problem is the dc os installer modifying ld library path to have opt mesosphere lib
the solution i followed is to create a container wrapper class that delegates all the required functions to the origional object as follows and in the mapper in this case both the floatimage and childfloatimage can be encapsulated in floatimagecontainer and you get rid of inheretance problems in hadoop because there is only one class used directly floatimagecontainer which is not parent child of any
background the reason for this is that type erasure makes it impossible for java to at runtime check that your mymapper actually extends the correct type in terms of the generic type parameters on mapper
java basically compiles into credits for this example go here so you are inputting mymapper where java wants to see mapper a b c d of specific a b c and d not possible at runtime
so you are inputting mymapper where java wants to see mapper a b c d of specific a b c and d not possible at runtime so we have to force that check at compile time
i don t think the ld library path would cause this particular error i wonder if the difference in the arg values have any impact
the default hive kerberos delegation token store method can cause failures with oozie hiveserver2 actions in certain environments
when using multiple hiveserver2 instances front ended by a load balancer oozie hive2 actions can start a connection and get a delegation token on the first hiveserver2 and then because of load balancing get another connection to the next hiveserver2 when making the query
this causes the second connection to fail
on azure linux based hdinsight is based on the ubuntu linux distribution
based on my knowledge for now azure does not support this
i suspect this error is caused by this line job2 is a job object and doesn t belong there you should use textoutputformat class or something similar instead
the replace columns in hive to add a completely new definition is not working in the hive version 1 3 for some reason i cant read new columns not sure if this is fix in other versions
additionally the schema evolution in spark was turned off because it is more expensive essentially you have to read all the files and consolidate the schema to work in this way and depending on your number of files this can impact the performance http spark apache org docs latest sql programming guide html schema merging
by default sqoop aplit your job in 4 mappers based on the pk of your table however depending on the distribution of your data this can be very inefficient
now coming to your question since you want to convert string to text format use something like this now when we call our flatmap function over javardd rddone it will take input as text since the output of rddone is text and it can give output whatever you want
but when i ran the same program against whole file then it gave me error due to some notation problem as i figured it out
i used same mapper as given in your question and this is the reducer i used this is the result i got let me know if you still face some issue
i find reason and workaround solution
hadoop work in that way application ask namenode about file namenode send a information about datanode s which stored a requested file and get address of datanode
that result in application try get file from unseen address
yes and no yes the number of mapper run in any stage depends on numbers of input splits
but there is no guarantee that there is going to be only one stage thus a total number of mappers in the execution of any query actually depends on the query itself which also answer your 2 question q2
now when you write a query for it in pig map reduce jobs might run in the following way to give a result
the first map reduce job will sort countries in descending order then saved the result now on the first map reduce result will run the second map reduce where it will select 3 4 and 5 most populated country and save it then on the result of second map reduce it ran the third map reduce job and again sorted them in desired order and displayed the final result major take away from this example is even though there was a single input split but the number of mapper ran was 3
q3 and q4 also have a similar answer like 1 and 2 it all depends on your query unless you have defined some constraint for combiner explicitly
the only reason why it was not working before is the invoke hive command
from https docs hortonworks com hdpdocuments hdp2 hdp 2 3 0 bk hdp relnotes content ch01s08s02 html so maybe you are implementing something wrong in the serde
the java io ioexception not a data file exception was due to the presence of a temporary directory holding metadata for processing
the solution is thus to delete flumespool and the issue resolved itself after releasing a bit of space from the disk of course
and it is wrong to transfer a arbitrary byte array to string because it s behavior is not controlled
since you are trying to use the default values i would suggest you to go with the option one
the problem of my program to find the class of keytab was the result of a bad configuration
this error could be either due to hiveserver2 not running or hue does not have access to hive conf dir
depending on your kerberos implementation
this is a java app so it s going to be expecting slashes in the opposite direction in your path to the config file so
hence replacing that library worked
it should look something like this depending on the location of the jar
and due to some unknown reasons the mapred site xml had no value because at start it was set
this is an issue with your python environment it s been corrupted somehow most likely using sudo pip install package using sudo and pip together can sometimes cause this issue
reference https web mit edu kerberos krb5 1 12 doc admin admin commands __ kadmin local html then you are good to get in hadoop environment but to read write execute hadoop directories you have to be either be the owner of the directory be in the group of that directory the directory has to give permission to other groups be in hadoop super user group which you are not as you mentioned based on my experience with hadoop linux or even windows servers majority of problems is related to permission issues
the error you see is because it cannot find the class files that a1 references
therefore it cannot load a1
the reason for the connectionrefused exception is because hdfs get started at 8020 that is why port 9000 is not expecting any request thus it refused the connection
your query wouldn t work anyway because you need to do the lead before you filter by day
the java home environmental variable was configured to be so i went ahead and changed it to the following i attempted to run the following command again in hopes that it would work thankfully mrjob picked up on the java home environment and resulted in the following output to fix the issue with the hadoop streaming jar i added the following switch to the command the full command looked like the following to which the following output was the result it seems the issue has been resolved and hadoop should process my job
i removed hadoop store hdfs namenode because that doesn t make sense
its because of your hadoop version the access modifier of setpinginterval method has been changed in hadoop 2 6 0 degrade your hadoop version to 2 5 1 and it will work fine
if its in 1000 then you will get the error as your mappers are dying because of oome
you can usually ignore memory overcommitted errors because most java applications use a fraction of their actual heap size
http blog cloudera com blog 2013 08 how to select the right hardware for your new hadoop cluster recommends the most likely reason your job is getting stuck is a lack of vcores
it will need at least 512mb of memory per vcore you have to account for the jvm
thus when i executed the command with privilege sudo my job mapreduce is executed successfully
parquet avro is mainly a convenience layer so that you can read write data that is stored in apache parquet into avro object
thus you should be fine with as parquetfile
i ve worked pretty deeply with mapreduce and other big data ecosystem parallel frameworks so hopefully i can provide some context
hadoop s advantages over most other models are fault tolerance and the fact that a lot of the low level details are abstracted away from the application developer so you don t need to be an expert systems programmer to get work done at multi petabyte scale
solution the checksumexception comes because i forgot to close the sequence writer after i finished from writing appending
this results in a sequence file that doesn t match its crc file
because of the interruption of downloading the packet is not complete and tomcat untar sh would occured an exception while trying to untar the tomcat
i think it s mainly because the map output has not been converted into text
i m not sure how to speed your operation as it really depends on your schema and the data
as for the crash it is likely that your job throws timeout exception due to long running computation in your bulk step without reporting the progress back to yarn in the mapreduce job scheduled by importtsv utility
download the jar and register as shown below note when you use load myfilepath this picks all the files in that directory
mahout is deprecating the old recommenders based on hadoop
we have a much more modern offering based on a new algorithm called correlated cross occurrence cco
its is built using spark for 10x greater speed and gives real time query results when combined with a query server
this method ingests strings for user id and item id and produces results with the same ids so you don t need to manage those anymore
there it says for the sdi hive adapter insert update and delete functions are more complicated than with standard sql and therefore they are not supported in this first version of the hive adapter
what you want to do is rank the records based on the amount per period then keep only the top 1 record for each period
since you don t say what to do about ties i e
you are not iterating your iterator val for that reason your logic in your code is executed one time for each group
normally for standard distributions such as apache hortonworks cloudera ignite guesses all the hadoop library locations based only on hadoop home environment variable value thus typically there is no need to specify the hadoop common home hadoop hdfs home hadoop mapred home explicitly
at the moment both lines 56 68 that look like so you can just change it too which will give you the format you re after
in that case you cannot have val column in table a because after aggregation which val from table b do you expect in table a
in map reduce program if you want to apply your on sorting logic on map output so that reducer will get data in some sorted order you need to do following things choose your composite key set sort comparator class set grouping comparator class set partition class for example if you have dataset like as below userid applicationid datetime and if you want to sort the row on basis of userid and datetime first you need to create a composite key class which consist of userid and datetime secondly you need to write sort comparator class in which you need to write your sorting logic thirdly you need to write grouping comparator class in which you want to compare value of keys on basis of one of the key not on basis of both the keys like in this example we just want to group the record with userid only
according to your description based on my understanding i think you want to copy all orc files from a cluster to another and load these orc files as a hive table
iso date format is yyyy mm dd since it seems the partition information is not part of the data you have 3 options 1
please see the reason for adding a disk or creating another logical volume in the centos volume group
i am not closing this question because later the code might be useful for someone
connectionlossexception can happen for a million reasons
you re not going to be able to just query whatever you want like you would in mysql and have it return results
so i know that if i run a query like this that in my particular table i m going to get 10 of the table s results back in my count
maheshgupta thank you for your answer when i am using float or long i have a result like this when i declare it in my schema as chararray i have this result my script is this one my big problem is for division or addition because i can t do it the type is a chararray
i will be sure to update this answer if i have any further findings on this so that it may be useful for others who may need it
additionally i m not sure why you re trying to run this program with hadoop since it does not have any of the hadoop implementations or classes
because select count launches a mapreduce job maybe you have issues on your config files try to test a map reduce job on your cluster execute this and change hadoop mapreduce examples jar with the jar version of your mapreduce exemples if you have hadoop 2 6 it will look like hadoop mapreduce examples 2 6 0 jar if you had errors then mr is not configured to work correctly
if so it is possible you can just modify the mapreduce application classpath on the client site if your software supports it
collect list uses arraylist so the data will be kept in the same order they were added to do that you need to use sort by clause in a subquery don t use order by it will cause your query to execute in a non distributed way
however that s going to result in the same numbers for example so i m not sure that s what you want therefore you may want to consider an outer join so you don t only get matching values i can t remember what results on the right side of the join but probably null
it will return no rows on empty dataset because you are using group by and having filter
also you can use shell to get result and test it on empty value
thank you all for your replies i am able to access the uis now page was displaying server not found so i tried to check hostname on box and replaced localhost with hostname ipaddress finally able to access both the uis now
if you find all node by the commnad your jps command doesn t work so you should remove hsperfdata folder from your tmp folder
the other way to receive emails on failure is using the email utility inside the script something like this before doing exit 1 echo script x returned an error due to some reason please check the workflow for validation mailx r oozie s subjecttoemail email someemail com to make the email utility work from data node make sure your data nodes have the email utility installed
if not installed you can do ssh on the email part to your edge node which looks something like this ssh o stricthostkeychecking no edgeuser edgehost echo script x returned an error due to some reason please check the workflow for validation mailx r oozie s subjecttoemail email someemail com i can suggest you some changes to your workflow which might give you better results on reflecting the errors and utilizing the email action in the workflow don t call the config file from the shell action itself instead you can do as below workflow app name shell test xmlns uri oozie workflow 0 5 start to shell 8f63 kill name kill message action failed error message wf errormessage wf lasterrornode message kill action name test shell shell xmlns uri oozie shell action 0 1 job tracker jobtracker job tracker name node namenode name node exec shell sh exec env var hadoop user name wf user env var file user oozie lib test shell sh shell sh file file user oozie input tables txt file shell if you notice the changes i made to your workflow i m just calling the tables txt as a file instead of actually making it as an execution by removing the tables txt when you do that what happens is shell action will actually copy that file and store in the container that it is running so to utilize the table txt config file inside the script you will call like this
tables txt because the container has already copied so you can call the tables txt as it is in the home directory
apart for the bucket name say mybucket i have also added the directory inside the bucket mybucket mydir which seems to have caused the problem
i m only answering because i don t have enough points to comment but you should try monitoring the status of each map task as it runs with the resourcemanager gui
a corrupted line causing unhandled exceptions and mapreduce map failures maxpercent 0 causing the job to terminate
analyze the logs and most likely you can get to the root cause
possible root causes your data might be malformed or different than what you are expecting in the mapper
another reason could be the data size and available memory on the node
i am suspecting that point 1 could be the reason as the process has tried to run the mapper for multiple time and failing
because the libraries that are available on internet might not work on your system otherwise you will have to generate your own system specific libraries form binaries available on internet to run hadoop on your windows
since your reduce method wasn t overriding any methods it wouldnt have been called and it would have used an identity reduce which matches your output
i believe this is because each drillbit only has the profile for the queries it was the foreman for
i found the answer from here you cant use hconfiguration because it defaults to a localhost quorum what you ll have to do is use the configuration that amazon sets up for you located in etc hbase conf hbase site xml the connection code looks like this
you can concatenate your line all together then you can split the result with 5 character check this splitting a string at every n th character you can inspire the solution from this piece of code output edit you can solve this problem like so output
this is a part of your error caused by java io filenotfoundexception app hadoop tmp 20 mapred local localrunner hduser jobcache job local973452829 0001 attempt local973452829 0001 m 000000 0 output file out index i m guessing it s a problem with the configuration property hadoop tmp dir in your core site xml because hadoop is unable to store the temporary output files from mapper to your disk
you can remove that property so that hadoop creates it s own temporary directory to store the intermediate output or set it to some directory with appropriate permissions
tested this script with your data now test the result
as written this is a bit non sensical because you can just do the distinct in the subquery will ensure that all values are unique
as a result a single reducer would have a lot of data compared to others
you try to come up with a partitioning function based on your group by key for your custom partitioner
that s because you have set index mapper dynamic false which means new types will not be created automatically without first declaring them
note in some posts i read that this error could be for lack of disk space non in my case and in other the reason was the so s version they recommended downgrade ubuntu 16 04 to 14 04
you could provide a subclass of the multipleoutputformat class to control the pattern of the filenames but that will need to be in java since you can t write outputformats with the streaming api
you ll have to use it s full name table 1 ids member id or table 2 member id they have the same value but they are still 2 different fields in join result
thanks to piyush and nazar for the comments
one way to get the desired result is to i uniquely label the keys to join on and ii separate the distinct statement
the reason was pretty silly
this is because cat is giving only first word before a space into the variable
the supported applications are hadoop hbase spark you probably should not scale with hive queries running because 1 hive is not in the list and 2 the document described what happens to hadoop jobs if you scale down with jobs running as below
thanks to ramesh i noticed that my hdfs commands were running on the current directory not on the hdfs location
regarding efficiency since the processing will be done in parallel its being taken care
in reality i find somehow a solution in order to not staying with same errors so i installed hadoop verion 2 6 2 configure the version using the xml then keep working is not good solution for everyone but i hope that will show light for others
you only need to group the dates which it seems you aren t formatting them correctly anyway based on your expected output
the main problem is about the sign of the reduce method i was writing public void reduce text key iterator textwritable values context context instead of this is the reason why i obtain my map output instead of my reduce otuput
there is nothing wrong with this approach as long as it meets your end result
as a result it s not a recommended practice
the error is not in the final line where you perform take but in the following line when a file is read using textfile api all the lines are converted to string thus the t tab is not preserved
so i modified the code which gave the correct result without any error
the error is because hadoop could not find org apache fontbox cmap cmapparser class which should be an external library that you have imported in your code
the external dependent jar was not packaged with the jar you used for hadoop command and thus hadoop system couldn t find the jar in hdfs
this is because when we run hadoop command codes jars get distributed to where data lies in hdfs cluster and thus the dependent jar was not found
that error message actually means could not reach the mysql service maybe the address port is wrong maybe it s not possible to reach this address port because of networking restrictions maybe the server is down enjoy the next phase of debugging
if your cluster nodes are in a restricted sub network and have no access to internet which makes sense for security reasons then sqoop mappers cannot reach your remote cloud service game over
you will have to try something else like running a spark local job on another server that has access to internet see below for the proxy configuration if your cluster nodes have access to internet via an internet proxy which is a bit lax on security but after all maybe you have no sensitive data in there then you have to configure your sqoop mappers so that they know about the proxy
note that the documentation hides many embarrassing points you cannot use an http https proxy for anything else than a http https request that won t work for jdbc to be precise it would require a recent version of java and custom java code something you cannot do here with sqoop you cannot use authentication with an http https proxy to be precise it would require custom java code something you cannot do here with sqoop you can use authentication with a socks proxy but it s documented elsewhere in the dark corner of networking properties if you configure java to use a socks proxy then all traffic will attempt to go through that proxy including the background hadoop communication therefore afaik you cannot use it with a sqoop mapper because it would simply disconnect the mapper from its yarn appmaster
the tricky part is that your default hadoop config and or sqoop might already use mapreduce map java opts for their own purposes and overriding their settings may cause the job to crash e g
it s pretty inefficient networking wise because all the data will have to be routed through the proxyfier node in out plus a number of extra ethernet switches
therefore since the mappers write continuously to the local hard disk a bottleneck is expected there when multiple hadoop executions are run even if we have cpu processing power to spare
as wang pointed out it s really due to my data skewing problem
then in my spark code i wrote a customized partitioner to repartition each entry based on its key this way there will be not hotspotting issue i e
rank return long type was a root cause
you can create one if you are running hadoop in local pseudo mode then just put localhost in that file if you are running hadoop in cluster mode then you need to add either ips or hostnames of all the slave machines in the cluster
although i wrote in my question that we had checked the the other domain supports kerberos aes encryption checkbox for the trust it seems that that checkbox has been changed since then no one can explain how or why
that is what caused the aes encryption of our trust to be rejected by the other trust
the code you are trying to use is using spring 3 which is made for java 1 6
the result was extracted to a folder called rhadoop under my working directory then try to unzip the file with untar function
you have keys mismatch in result log
without that you will get wrong results
these text files are given as input in the map reduce program because input file size is very small only 1 input split is generated by framework for 1 input
as i have one record per input split so one mapper reducer is assigned to do task for that input split
what you could do to remove a domain without restarting from zero would be to add a pattern to the url filters so that the urls get deleted from the crawldb during the update step or at least not selected during the generation step
unless you are clear on what you re doing you shouldnt generally be overriding the run method so i would completely remove this from the reduce class
i solved by downloading hadoop 2 8 0 and doing all exact configuration as i did with previous hadoop eventhough i don t know what exactly was causing the error or warning
if anyone could point out the cause i would be thankful
so in java the type of mat is stored under cvtype class so you need to create the matrix as
there was just about 10g free so it was causing an issue to add 12g image
the exception was thrown because metrics core jar was missing from spark driver extraclasspath
it means you haven t started your metastore service so start you metastore service where you installed hive or in the remote if you have your metastore in remote
order by position is supported since hive 0 11 but only from hive 2 2 0 it is turned on by default
i have abig headache about stopping and restarting firewall scenarios and i discovered that stopping firewall at rc local is a fake stopping so because idon t want fire wall to work at all i ended up with the following solution https www rootusers com how to disable the firewall in centos 7 linux so firewall is not going to work again at any boot
i am not sure regarding build sbt since i use maven but dependencies look fine
a smaller value causes timeout checks to occur more often
copy the hbase site xml to all your cluster hosts and restart the hbase master and regionserver processes for the change to take effect
something probably set ld library path to include the directory opt lampp lib thus overriding the system version of that library
usually it should not affect the other application because the official libgcc s so 1 library as provided by upstream and most distributions is very backwards compatible so using a newer version is always okay
when exporting the jar out of eclipse i unchecked classpath because i was not running it locally
based on the following jiras increasing the protobuf size seems to require a code change since all these jiras were resolved with code patches using codedinputstream as suggested by the exception
hdfs 6102 lower the default maximum items per directory to fix pb fsimage loading hdfs 10312 large block reports may fail to decode at namenode due to 64 mb protobuf maximum length restriction
the following steps are required for setting up a cluster with amabari setting up passwordless ssh letting ambari make use of this the symptoms you see occur in part 2 but judging from the comment the root cause of the problem is actually in part 1
if manual ambari agent registration is not an option for some reason and you must use ssh then you can add the key fingerprint of the remote host by executing the following command
okey so i actually solved this
sometimes sbt maven runs successfully but creates empty jars due to directory structure
hdfs directory tmp logs is the default location used for mapreduce log aggregation there is another critical property which is https fr hortonworks com blog simplifying user logs management and access in yarn a typical cluster purges mr logs after 5 to 30 days depending on activity and maybe compliance requirements
write a shell script to pick up oozie job logs using redirect results of it into a file which you may load into a hive table
i had the same issue so i made the hipi jar by myself by integrating necessary packages
the javadoc states public boolean removeshutdownhook thread hook throws illegalstateexception if the virtual machine is already in the process of shutting down so if we are getting this exception it means we are already in the process of shutdown so we cannot try what we may removeshutdownhook
i discovered that my problem was in journal node and not in namenode even though the log of namenode shows the error mentioned in question jps shows journal node but it is fake because journal node service is shut down even though it is found in jps output so as a solution i issue hadoop daemon sh stop journalnode then hadoop daemon sh start journalnode and then namenode starts to work again
a bit late but for those running into this now this can be caused by the maven version used for spark core or spark sql not being compatible with the spark version being used on the server
because sc available your shell
1gb bzip2 compressed by setting the number of reducers accordingly via dmapreduce job reduces xxx to all jobs writing the crawldb updatedb inject mergedb dedup however to find the optimal options for your cluster setup and hardware may require some experiments
try like this instead of this the error is due to the non availability of the hive jdbc jar while trying to run your java code which inturn tries to load the hive jdbc jar hope this helps
i want to get details of a particular workflow appname from the oozie rest api and thus tried to find some documentation reference about the parameters that we can pass like appname user etc to the oozie rest endpoints which could filter down the results in the json from all the workflows running in the oozie server to the one i want
d and data are used for same purpose hence first occurance i e
data takes effect and command tried to locate file with no path i e
issue in how the s3 clients work with root directories
i think it not regarding your os 7 and os 6 because hadoop is deployed by master machine and slaves machines once you have deployed the master nodes other nodes can direct join the hadoop cluster
also the yarn will responsible for the task scheduling
as the error sugest its not able to find the pacakages in the repository for some reasons so i added them from unbuntu software and updates
i think you are completly missing the concept of the reducer because thats exactly its function the reducer input will be a key in this case hadoop and a list of values associated with this key 7 and 5 so your reducer program will iterate the values list and do the summation and then hadoop 13
thus a stupid mistake lead to a wild goose chase
pdi has a free plug in able to run ruby code out of the box so you can save start up development
the pdi also has ready made spark and hadoop interfaces so you can implement your hadoop sparkle servers transparently at a later stage if you need a more metal solution
try to run since start all sh and stop all sh located in sbin directory while hadoop binary file is located in bin directory
also updated your bashrc for so that you can directly access start all sh
some where its space and some where its tab may be its because copy pasting
download and run that is because org apache spark logging had been canceled at spark 1 6
spark submit yarn mode hadoop conf dir contents alternatively as mentioned in that post the best way would be getting your cluster s xml files from hadoop conf dir and copying them over into your application s classpath
and yes you need to add a remote user account for your local windows username on all the nodes
the org apache hadoop hbase masternotrunningexception is part of hbase home lib hbase client jar jar hence you need to add it in classpath as follows
due to a fix existing adding this as answer instead of just comments the issue is that the yammer version you have is not compatible with hbase
i solved this issue as there is issue in caused by java lang noclassdeffounderror com yammer metrics core gauge so adding metrics core 2 2 0 jar to hadoop classpath doesnt work so i added this jar to hadoop mapred lib hdfs lib common lib folder thus this jar is available in classpath
i suggest you to open the issue in astor https github com spoonlabs astor issues first and we ll see if it s related to astor or spoon
if you can when you ll create the issue provide the full command line argument you used with astor so i ll be able to replicate easily your bug
i have created helloworld h cpp separately from actual hadoop program so the full path was not matching
if you want to call the script with oozie it needs to be placed on hdfs because you ll never know which node will run the launcher
0 0 0 0 8032 is the default yarn resource manager so you need to configure your hadoop conf dir xml files specifically yarn site for this error to point at the docker container for the correct addresses of yarn
had similar problem that was caused by network paths in dyld library path and system integrity protection disabled
user anonymous you are not authenticated as either suser or a part of the supergroup group the permissions are set to drwxrwx so i m not sure how you checked that otherwise but it means nobody but the user or group can access
instead of what you re doing try this i m not familiar with hadoop so it s not clear to me what the semantics of path are but presumably it ll make sense to someone who knows hdfs
the http request to http corpus byu edu wikitext samples text zip results in an 301 moved permanently giving new location https corpus byu edu wikitext samples text zip
turns out when you copy paste the command from notepad to terminal changes and results into an error we need to explicitly write in the temrinal
after trying the solution present at hadoop socket timeout error link in my question and adding below to hdfs site xml file the issue was resolved by allowing all icmp and udp rules to the ec2 instances so they can ping between each other
it could be due to the default setting user hive warehouse in the hive site xml is not properly created or permission granted
3 create the hadoop folder by using hadoop fs mkdir usr hive wawrehouse if non existing take a look at the access right using hadoop fs ls 4 use hadoop fs chmod g w usr to grant the needed right either the user vs usr or the set up of the warehouse could be common causes reference from hive site xml note you also have to make sure another hadoop folder tmp is also properly set as above
depending on your configuration sometimes its possible to workaround this via java policy file changes on the client side to grant access to the sun io package
it s possible that you could write a custom el function to do a date calculation see the answer here which returns a period number based on the current day of year
your code works fine for the sample input so it looks to be an issue with your data where there will be erroneous rows which are unable to process
i think you are looking for serdeproperties rather than tblproperties otherwise try selecting individual fields until you find the one that s causing the error then inspect what type s the avsc are being mapped into the hive table as
you can see in your logs you re getting the following error attemptid attempt 1507879413631 0001 m 000000 0 timed out after 10 secs you can try upping the timeout by modifying the setting here yours is set to 10 seconds normally a timeout of 600 is used 10 minutes so you could change it to 600000
the file is inside the jar file so you should ask jvm to give you the file
because when you do a renewal when there is no keytab it is ofcourse pointless
and third if you use the query option it s mandatory to include the conditions token and since you re using double quotes to issuing the query you need to conditions instead of just conditions to disallow your shell from treating it as a shell variable
this is probably because your hive distribution version and metastore schema versions are different
so it is the compression decompression that is causing the size to increase of decryption
when i displayed the file with hadoop fs cat command it looked ok so i changed the column to bigint and now it is displaying the size correctly
check the column name on the source side as sqoop considers them as case sensitive and change their name accordingly
get the firewall rules updated so that you also have access to the datanodes
first limitation does not depends on oozie but on resources available in yarn to execute oozie actions as each action is executed in one map
the major limit we ve faced leading to troubles was on the callable queue of oozie services
load the data as a single field write a udf and pass the field as parameter in your udf use a loop to go through all columns by splitting the field based on the delimiter and limit all columns to desired length reconstruct the line and return the single field the below script and udf should get you on the right track
those files are in different folders depending on which distribution of hadoop you are using
the above error is oom out of memoryexception because you are storing the rdd in memory after addition of some rdd s to the memory the executor will run out of memory exception by default cache store that rdd s in memory check the below option will help you to store your rdd to disk only you may also have few options like memory and disk memory and disk ser memory only memory only ser each option will suffixed with 2 means no of copies in disk or memory and ser means serialization to reduce storage space either in disk or in memory
working with external hive tables where you deleted the hdfs folder i see two solutions drop the table files will not be deleted because the table is external then re create the table using the same location and then run msck repair table
for example if you are using the hortonworks data platform hdp it has a hive version based on 1 2 x but is closer to 2 0
hence causing the error
you have not provided any insight on your code so i can t guide you accurately
i couldn t test if this solution works because you haven t provided a reproducible example but you can try something like this
use appliance hdp 2 4 virtualbox because in the most recent some linux commands like netstat are considered deprecated and no longer function which willmake your life harder when trying to debug or identify a networking problem
issue is due to the bracket once i remove the bracket from after create view view name as it stated working
unlike hive cli which is an apache thrift based client beeline is a jdbc client based on the sqlline cli although the jdbc driver used communicates with hiveserver2 using hiveserver2 s thrift apis
as hive development has shifted from the original hive server hiveserver1 to the new server hiveserver2 users and developers accordingly need to switch to the new client tool
the reason for the protocol mismatch is given by cricket 007 in the comments this was due to a wrong port in the curl i x put http ip port webhdfs v1 op create statement
the thing about hadoop is that it scales well not only due to parallel processing but thanks to parallel io when data is distributed across multiple servers storage media
can you use it to filter rows which haven t been updated since the previous run
even if the timestamp is not the time of last updates can you add an updatetime field and triggers on updates which will populate the field so you don t need to import rows which have not changed since the previous run
based on your suggestions i made the below change to the code and i can now cal this udf from hive shell
but the result it is returning is infinity for the calculation
i tried changing the data type for tuplecount to long and double its still causing the same problem
this error is generated because your username has an space so for this reason appear 20 in your directory
based on the number of nodes in the cluster the spark thrift server can be brought up for e g on aws emr you can use with 1 small r3 2xlarge node also ensure monitoring or cleaning up the spark history folder hdfs dfs ls var log spark apps on emr queries will be stuck if multiple jobs are in inprogress state in the folder there is a way to set up automated cleanup of spark history folder
the issue was because the directories usr lib hadoop 0 20 mapreduce usr lib hadoop hdfs usr lib hadoop mapreduce usr lib hadoop yarn were not present in the docker container
i have three log files in that are log index log dir hadoop home libexec logs userlogs job 201712081441 0002 attempt 201712081441 0002 r 000000 0 the others are sys log that have the same output as the shell and 2 others empties files
it makes since that you need these because the mapred package has dependencies on them
it also makes sense those versions are missing from the common repositories because hadoop 0 21 0 is rather old
here s a simple example of something that you could run and test very easily from the interpreter depending on your requirements and level of sophistication that you require here it would likely be more pythonic to approach this problem by using the subprocess module but os system may be what you were looking for
thus i created a user myname same name as my active directory name across all nodes
you have to cast mileslogged and then call the sum function also i noticed that you are not specifying the datatype in the load statement the default datatype is bytearray and i suspect you will get the correct result if you don t explicitly cast the fields in the subsequent steps
i was able to get this page working by setting share jobs to true in etc hue conf empty hue ini so the following worked for me
therefore upgrade one at a time if you re reusing the same hardware
since we couldn t find a way to execute jobs through carte with v7 1 we decided to follow the simplest approach of ssh commands which works fine
you need to group in order to count since that is an aggregate operation
output note none of the users in your example repeat so these are all one
it s possible to encounter the following exception java lang noclassdeffounderror org apache hadoop hbase hbaseconfiguration this is caused by the fact that sometimes the hbase test jar is deployed in the lib dir
also the initial instance set is to initial instance 2015 01 01t00 00z and frequency is 1 day so it will increment the by 1 day but hours will be same 00 00z
if the file is not there for some reason you can create the xml file that references the configuration xsl xml version 1 0 xml stylesheet type text xsl href configuration xsl then you will fill out your configuration element
for your task unless there s a vpn so that the the emr cluster can see the other one you won t get access
so here is the program i will suggest you to review the hadoop jars you have added specially on the hadoop core x x x jar because after watching your error it seems you have not added some mapreduce jar to the project
this problem results from a method depreciation in spark 2 2 the appuiaddress no longer exist in spark 2 2
all of this accumulated leading to the extremely high number of threads that jvm were not able to handle
managed to identify a different route however im not sure about the reason for the above mentioned failure considered the python way of complete list
if you want carlos to be a directory you need to delete the file and make it also trailing slashes should generally be used when copying files into a directory like so you could also just make your pig code load carlos as the file
there might be many reasons you are facing this issue the listener is not configured properly the listener process service is not running re start it with the lsnrctl start command or on windows by starting the listener service
i guess hashtag implementation is causing the issue
ambari blueprint is using the following file to set up it s repositories http public repo 1 hortonworks com hdp centos6 2 x updates 2 6 3 0 hdp 2 6 3 0 235 xml curl ss http public repo 1 hortonworks com hdp centos6 2 x updates 2 6 3 0 hdp 2 6 3 0 235 xml grep repoid repoid hdp 2 6 repoid repoid hdp utils 1 1 0 21 repoid ambari automatically adds repo 1 to the repoid before looking for the repositories on the target systems so we get hdp 2 6 repo 1 hdp utils 1 1 0 21 repo 1 hortonworks offer their own yum repo file here http public repo 1 hortonworks com hdp centos6 2 x updates 2 6 3 0 hdp repo but the repository ids are different curl ss http public repo 1 hortonworks com hdp centos6 2 x updates 2 6 3 0 hdp repo grep hdp 2 6 3 0 hdp utils 1 1 0 21 if ambari does not find the repository which it doesn t because the ids are different then it adds it s own which breaks your setup

right now hbase testing util does not work with hbase shaded serverand habse shaded client because of the below open issue https issues apache org jira browse hbase 15666
in the cte the column is called number so i would expect the query to look like to look like
and logstash and or kafka are the persistent channels flume would be reading your hdfs site xml for the s3 access keys so that s where it would get your keys from you can install es hadoop to get elastic to read data from hadoop and the s3 filesystem
i haven t tried this personally but i know the library exists for that reason
i see that you have created external table so you cannot add or drop partition using hive
the result of a group operation is a relation that includes one tuple per group
note that the group and thus cogroup and join operators perform similar functions
since hadoop 2 8 the property yarn node labels fs store retry policy spec is added to control that situation
this issue doesn t repro for runtime scripts since at the point the script is run example jars has already existed
the error was because in core site xml file ip address of cluster was mentioned by me where as hostname was recognized by the cluster
hence because of this ambiguity this error was happening
over the summer the broker migrated to ssl so the current url would be amqps anonymous anonymous dd weather gc ca the web page has also moved to https github com metpx sarracenia best practice to put authentication info in config sarra credentials conf a line like amqps anonymous anonymous dd weather gc ca installing a version from the past year is likely to be a much better experience
it could take many hours to prove it because this particular set severe weather warnings in common alerting protocol format is produced only when needed rather than continuously
extract them into a bin folder inside your hadoop home i have a folder c hadoop hadoop 2 8 1 bin with the binaries inside the bin run zeppelin cmd connect to localhost 8080 from your browser i was having trouble because the zeppelin page never mentions that you need to have a hadoop home and the winutils exe binary
relevant zeppelin jira issue in https issues apache org jira browse zeppelin 2438
i use 1 hadoop 2 7 6 2 derby 10 12 1 1 3 hive 2 1 0 this is my hive site xml file this is the steps that i have done create a directory let s say testhive in drive c run start all cmd switch to testhive directory start startnetworkserver h 0 0 0 0 in testhive directory check networkservercontrol start hive cmd in testhive directory finally this the result i get this is the content of testhive directory note i assume that you have set all the variables and paths correctly in windows environment variables and run cmd as administrator hope this will help you solve your problem
the most likely reason for this is that you re running an old version of hadoop that exposed a difference interface in programdriver
i copied them out to local and then examined them in a text editor to find more diagnostic information about the detailed results of the reducer phase
that happens because you are trying to sort your data using a field with type text
for instance from the link posted above you can search for new or york and find a value of new york because it s been run through an analyzer
i d guess the issue is caused by wrong symlinks at usr hdp
see https docs hortonworks com hdpdocuments ambari 2 6 0 0 bk ambari security content how to configure ambari server for non root html ambari version 2 5 1 0 is considerably outdated so it would make sense to update ambari and see whether it helps
also you are trying to resubmit job which is bound to fail because each mr job needs a new output directory
the only reason hive would split a new line is if you only defined the table stored as text which by default uses new lines as record separators not field separators
and user yarn does not have permission to execute jobs there because of drwx
depends on how you want to store your duration field
you only created a directory for input so you can either mkdir the full path with the variable if you want that command to run as is or you need to remove the variable when running the jar file as long as hdfs dfs ls input shows some files then that command looks fine otherwise but i m not sure what that java class is actually expecting as input note there is a difference between and more specifically hdfs doesn t have home folders so it looks like you re either not running pseudo distributed cluster or you made that directory yourself
the problem is due to classloader is not found in your hadoop file path
the spark interpreter can be instantiated globally per note or per user i don t think sharing the same interpreter globally is a solution in your case since you can only run one job at a time
it also mentions that textinputformat is the default mapreduce input type which is a type of fileinputformat and therefore the default input types must be long text pairs as the javadoc says the book also has sections on defining custom recordreaders you need to call job setinputformatclass to change it to read anything other than single lines
thanks to amita for helping me out
noted however what the cause is
there can be 2 possible scenario your hive configuration and hardware is such that hive itself takes a large amount of time to get outputs for the query the bandwidth or the transport speed inter slave nodes is slow so even after hive executes the query quickly due to slow speed of transfer of data from hive to pyspark it takes a lot of time
the error is because you put a reference on the left join between t1 and t14 but you put t3 on the condition
also depending on what you are doing writableutils has the methods writeenum and readenum
reason it is giving permission issue is because you are trying to put the file inside user directory in hdfs since you are using 2 dots in put statement
the best solution is to ensure you have dns properly configured wherever accumulo and its clients are running so that accumulo will detect and advertise a hostname which is also known to external clients
you can also use another name service implementation by configuring etc nsswitch conf appropriately see man nsswitch conf so that inetaddress getlocalhost gethostname returns something which would be recognized by an external client
in some of the convenience scripts provided by some versions of accumulo the a option is attempted to be automatically set based on what is returned from ifconfig and or what is contained in the conf slaves file
in most scenarios the behavior of these scripts has the same result as inetaddress getlocalhost gethostname so using dns or etc hosts as your nameservice will be best
the previous answer doesn t scale up well with big data primarily as joins are expensive due to the extra shuffles
for instance you can make sure that the data is different by executing the following command on both of your masters and then compare the output kdb5 util tabdump keydata the correct case for the cross realm authentication is when there are two or at least two kdc masters responsible for different realms in different domains and you still want users from one realm to authenticate in another realm https web mit edu kerberos krb5 1 5 krb5 1 5 4 doc krb5 admin cross 002drealm authentication html when there are two kdcs in one realm and domain it would make sense to make one of them a master kdc and another one slave
which leads me to a question what was the reason for having the second kdc master in the first place
of cause you can use a key value store adding some kind of complexity to the overall solution
also since you are essentially doing a decimal division you could add another conv function to convert it to decimal
that is the reason why you have these steps
when you read a file using map reduce the file input format the default one reads an entire line and sends it to the mapper in the format of so the input to the mapper becomes in case you need to read as you would need to change the file input format and use your custom file input format along with the custom record reader
there can be certain reasons for it
oozie supports the kerberos delegation using credentials https oozie apache org docs 4 2 0 dg actionauthentication html so you should not need to authenticate within java just use a standard jdbc connection
the root cause is that i just config the master server ip in etc hosts
so i can t get the whole folder because the file must in different datanodes
i ran below commands here i have created a dummy address table in my database output 101 india xxx so the issue could be with your dataset and not with the commands you are running
looking from your error java lang numberformatexception empty string it looks like that your error exists while you are trying to parse integer from string for which string is empty so you will this particular erorr
depending on your version of cdh spark2 has a builtin csv reader
the issue as per logs is below caused by java util concurrent executionexception java lang numberformatexception for input string 0006244 0000 java lang numberformatexception occurs when you are trying to parse some input which not a number string
i have not been able to figure out i just tried again since i miss neon so much but even though 9000 is not in use the os sends a sigterm in my case too
this totally depends on what is your id column
also don t need any index to perform incremental load with sqoop but an index will definitely help as its absence will lead to fullscan s to the source and possibly very big table
kms can t use hdfs as the backing storage because each hdfs client file access would go through a loop of hdfs namenode kms hdfs namenode kms
you can use the following function and later on parse it to the desired result
if using the above command sqoop needs the hive import clause as well and that is where it was failing because it is expecting an underlying table everytime sqooped
your error starts at caused by unrecognized hadoop major version number 3 0 1
because this is incompatible with hadoop and mahout versions
for instance i had set it as but instead do this very simple fix causing so many problems
notation so it works this way
and it s not spark specifically that s the issue also hdfs put will say that a file already exists if you try to place it in the same location so the fact you were able to upload twice should be an indication that your path was incorrect
try making these changes in your code and running the test again line 27 outputstream out fs create new path dir file to outputstream out fs create new path home hadoop setenv sh line 54 assertthat stat getblocksize is 64 124 1024 to assertthat stat getblocksize is 128 1024 1024l if test fails because of owner line 55 assertthat stat getowner is hadoop to assertthat stat getowner is os user running the test
what s more i take it for granted that there should be a file dir file in either local file system or hdfs due to i have no idea of the use of minidfscluster in this example anyway what i should do is to learn more
solution this error happens due to all new mysql version come up with added password plugin called caching sha2 password and it has to be configured properly at mysql server or else you can simply use mysql native password parameter with create user in mysql as below to get it resolved
altarnative if you still facing the problem then this is the problem because the new version of mysql you can refer my answer at below link
i use jessie as the new openssl libs in stretch cause compile problems with hadoop so specifically this release http downloads raspberrypi org raspbian lite images raspbian lite 2017 07 05 you ll need to install the build dependencies i use these but they do include all the ones need for hadoop compilation too so you could slim it down quite a bit then download unpack and build hue 3 11 0 i ve tested this with 3 11 3 12 4 1 and 4 2 using the same build environment on the pi 3
because tail will show data from the end and head will display data from the top
to solve this you need to increase the varchar max value of the column type names in the table columns or columns v2 depending on the hive version
hence it was available during compilation phase but was not available when i ran it via intellij
the reason for this warning is because you didn t configure your hive correctly
that s a problem because it comes handy using sudo to build the package and that s the reason that protoc version could not return something
you re receiving outofmemory because you never close your stream hence memory leak
after that you assign that value to some ref variable i guess that you re still having reference to old ref data somewhere hence the internal map data is not released
ranger supports column level security rules so you can block sensitives columns to non authorized users or even better replace values by masks eg john doe becomes xxxxxxxx there is no way to block the access to hdfs file s containing the data otherwise hive won t be able to read it
killing container because my spark driver was going up with default configuration i put this driver memory 5gconfig in my spark submit jar and solve my problem
i recommend to use s3 distcp utility because its already available in emr cluster
this simply means that something in the backend dbms decided to stop working due to unavailability of resources etc
probably using fs default name instead of fs defaultfs is not root cause of mapreduce job startup
it may caused by your fs defaultfs port and dfs namenode rpc address port are not the same
hdp components are configured by ambari so their configuration is stored at ambari db but how other runtime data is stored depends on particular component architecture
this is due to a java library compatibity issue
and it caused the noclassfound exception
if you use amazon emr services you will not run into this problem since all jars will get added to the paths appropriately
if s3a s3n s3 filesystem could not be instantiated then it is due to the aws sdk jars are not in the path
the reducer according to out config was supposed to accept key of type intwritable but was getting longwritable hence the error
to map is not recognized is because hive does not have that function
if it s required to use the particular column in the query you can run the query select closed extract date open close ceiling rand 1000000 from table name in the console get the column name thus coming for the table in the console and use it in split by complete column name from console here it should be split by ceiling rand 1000000
i found the reason of problem
if using this way then both hiveconf can be removed because you aren t using it
this can be because for wrong jar file with respective to java version
first you put the file at the root of hdfs not your user folder therefore the parameter must be wordcountfile second it looks like you ve made an executable jar so you can remove the class name from the parameters
i think you have an issue in your execution command the error is about finding the configuration file
the reason causes the exceptions is the environment setting at etc environment should set path and java home correctly
note that cloudera manager runs https on port 7183 so you re https link would not work even if it were open but your 7180 should work
there are few ways to debug this before that let me answer your questions you are right you need to use the security keystores gateway jks path so that beeline or any jdbc client can trust the certificates presented by knox
hence context write word one in the map method populates and reuses the word and one objects
hence you can safely reuse the objects within map method
if so it means that you don t have any databases in hive at all
i think its some issue in the ingestion data
now to fix this you need to set used false to one of the segment which you think is not correct based on your segment granularity and data
ideally druid performs best with utc timezone though you can change the timezone but i would rather recommend against it and have the ingestion data set the date time accordingly
the namenode had not finished tailing the editlog which contained information about generating the corresponding token thus failed to find the token in its local cache
thus if the namenode could not find the token during the transition it can wrap the invalidtoken exception in the retriableexception and ask the client to retry
issue is because of the extra blank new lines in the csv files
you also can use this because you xyz file is empty so you don t got error
is a wild card so it s looking for any file inside the folder
thanks to this blog
parallelcollectionrdd keeps a reference to the original data so it requires at least as much memory on the driver and therefore is not scalable
when i have seen this is because of a few reasons it can be a red herring error that batches multiple ones together
if this broke because of a relatively rare error you will find it here
first of all you have to create special table because it would be transactional so by default its off
i m not sure to enable debug logging in impyla so you ll need to go to the yarn ui to find the query
i think it because i forgot to set the network restriction in aws network settings so datanode cannot connect to namenode
based on my exprience any error about class not found is because of mapred site xml wrong configuration
what could be the cause is that the client is defaulting to talk to s3 through the default central endpoint not the us west one
row counter is based on map reduce
it is due to windows dynamic port range a worked solution 1 disable windows virtual platform form windows feature it will ask for restart 2 issue these couple of commands 3 enable previously disabled features again
basically problem is hadoop env file where it pick your username as admin configure your system your name with space which cause issue
like this since it seems that your problems is more related with keys you can try using ssh i your key file username ip addr p port
this is because the following configuration is taking effect from the documentation so essentially hive can infer that the input is a group of small files smaller than the blocksize and combine them reducing the required number of mappers
result
using this regex in scala repl the desired results for the given test input can be obtained as shown below
so that is where you should define the type of scheduler you want to use
your table already exists on hdfs you should add target dir path on hdfs syntax and then create an external hive table based on your target dir
do you format the namenode more than once if so the namenode will update the clusterid each time when it is formatted but the datanode will only be determined when it is first formatted
hope this helps anyone who has this issue in the future
therefore i guess that the array is smaller
another cause your task might be slow
again it s based on your use case whether to chose hive or nosql databases
i found the reason via viewing the job jar on the nodemanager machine
i believe i understand what your issue is which due to the large size of the file
for files that are much larger though the speed can take significantly longer based on the file size as well as speed and latency and a bunch of other network things
all of that is said because you don t return a response to the post request until the upload is done
one option would be to increase the total time the connection would stay open which is probably not the best solution for a production system with a bunch of users for various reasons
there would be various ways to do that based on the overall system configuration
based on your code you would have to change the way you handle the problem and you can use celery and or websockets to return when the upload is completed
hdp does not offer any stack with hadoop 2 9 0 you would therefore need to manually install that version of hadoop yourself although you can still manage the servers but not the hadoop configuration using ambari in any case there s little benefit to installing a lower version of the software plus you won t get hortonworks support if you do that
taking a step back since that information can be overwhelming there s two possible ways to authenticate to a hadoop cluster
since i m using the latter i can give you a quick code snippet to get you started
be careful you understand the consequences of which one you re using since some set global values
besides your vm is a single machine anyway so the requirement of running on multiple machines doesn t make much sense
you need to store the result then check and output
the reason why it was not working was because i have deleted the files in the spark folder in the cluster but not in my local spark folder needed to delete both
if a numeric value in sas has a format applied you will see the formatted possibly rounded version of the numeric value wherever you output the value but the underlying numeric may still have more significant digits that you re not seeing due to the format
the description is optional so feel free to delete that tag entirely
many of us struggling failing on daily during the install of hadoop on their own machine due to one or another reason
i see three issues in your query 1
although i do not know what your goal is i think that your query will not deliver the desired result
in this example you wouldn t need to group by after the subquery because the grouping is done in the subquery a
the error is because of you already start a standalone zookeeper that uses the port 2181
seems the problem was due to privilege at root directory using chmod 755 worked then
to bring a close to this since we are not using ldap ad at this time but our linux environment does leverage ldap the issue was that amabri was attempting to create local users
after around 2 3 service accounts the whole deployment script on the back end would time out since there is an overall timer on the deployment with ambari
in my cluster logged in user did not have permission to create directories in hadoop user directory hence i had to execute hadoop fs mkdir hdir with sudo
i think it depends on the what kind of compression logic is used to compress the files
when dealing with large volumes of data both of these savings can be significant so it pays to carefully consider how to use compression in hadoop
reasons to compress a data is mostly stored and not frequently processed
c decompression is very fast like snappy and thereof we have a some gain with little price d data already arrived compressed reasons not to compress a compressed data is not splittable
however your long stacktrace clearly states you have 0 datanodes up and running so the error seems to be not starting hdfs
cloudera has chosen to not be part of odpi so hawq and pxf do not work with their distribution
if this is your case then just configure these properties in that file
furthermore we have string get json object string json string string path which extracts json object from a json string based on json path specified returns json string of the extracted json object
this is due to restrictions on hive column names
you need to be on target cluster where you want to get the data so from target cluster are you able to make webhdfs call hftp call to source cluster if yes then only you will be able to
i also replaced the tab in your print statement with a pipe symbol since the tab is what will be used by the reducer to separate the key string and value count
according to the error you output it indicates that you have specified the wrong path for your python script caused by java io ioexception error 2 no such file or directory check the path and try again
as there is an opening single quote before set operation so it will take next quote as closing quote
in this way the results will be correct
i used the key sales so that all the values with the same key will reach the same reducer
based on sqoop documentation list databases command only works against mysql oracle and hsqldb databases
hence the number of records for a day doesn t remain constant at netezza side
in fact i suspected from the beginning some problem with my ide intellij idea 14 because i had to deal with a major refactoring of the code which then made the code reveal the issue
as a solution for your problem perform the following steps clear all the datanode directories local directories where datanode stores data format the namenode start the cluster since you already formatted the namenode i am assuming you don t have any critical data because you will loose all the data with the namenode format
hive would probably be querying as the hive user and hence either should be a owner of the file or should be in the right group
or in tmp user hive log and see the log caused by org apache hadoop hive contrib serde2 regexserde not found go to http www java2s com code jar h downloadhivecontrib081jar htm then in hive add the jar according to your system path output
here is a general procedure on getting it to work create an hdinsight cluster with hive metastore specified and one or more additional storage accounts for data storage
lzo compressed text files can not be processed in parallel because they are not splittable i e
the reason is that the udf you are using thinks it is acceptable to skip over these errors
you could create your own udf based on the udf that you are using and throw an exception instead of a warning upon an error
see this other so question for details on how to do this
based on the pig 0 12 documentation hivecolumnarloader appears to require an intermediate relation before you can filter on a non partition value
z display then xhost local fi the commented out entries above are for testing other stuff if this setup didn t work but for us it worked give permissions for the above script sudo chmod 755 etc profile d compute sh x setup resets if one logs in out from the lightdm so the following was added into etc lightdm lightdm conf greeter show manual login true greeter setup script etc profile d compute sh session setup script etc profile d compute sh reboot the system so that the environment variables are set for all the users including mapred now we can run opencl codes from hadoop
you are not getting error because you have created partition over your hive table but not assigning partition name during select statement
suppose i have the input file as below say xyz txt 111 001 222 121 001 222131 001 222141 001 222151 001 222161 001 222171 001 222 now 001 is my hive default delimiter say now in order to parse this file which is already loaded to hive table using map reduce i will do something like this in my map method your driver method will be normal one as follows so the final output will be as follows based on my map method that i have given 111 1121 1131 1141 1151 1161 1171 1it this what your are looking for like the parsing i am doing in my map method
first it was because namenode in safemode then after because of two ip address i have two nic configured on cdh cluster one internal connectivity of the servers 10 0 0 1 and other is to connect servers form internet 192 168 0 1 when i try to open namenode gui form any of the server connected to cluster on network 10 0 0 1 then gui is opening and works fine but from other any other machine connected to servers by 192 168 0 1 network it fails
this is happening because some of the required jars are missing from the eclipse plugin which comes with the hadoop distribution
if you find any modify your configuration files in all the nodes accordingly
the reasons for the error could be dns issues http threads on the mapper side or jvm bug that cause connections to get map outputs fail
i believe the filechannel had some updates in that time so you may like to retest using a build of that
if you fail to find repo containing all packages you need or you just don t want to add new repo for some reasons you can google them download them manually and install via dpkg i package deb
this happens sometimes because a classnotfoundexception missing the but the complete stacktrace of the log with some luck will tell
i was using openjdk that was causing this issue
if they are being executed serially then the failure of one will will cause the entire job to fail
one probable cause would be that the output data emitted would be huge
hence if you are facing the similar issue remove all configuration xmls and place the jar with only the compiled class files
result total data size the total data generated is o n 2
the total data read write from the harddisk in your cause during the shuffle phase can be 6 sizeof intermediate data which is very large
while if the data is generated by the reducer the o n 2 intermediate data transformation is unnecessary so it could have a better performance
so your performance issue is mainly caused by data transformation not computation
it is because you need to specify both the file in multipleoutputs where you want to write particular output to
note that because of your requirement to include the date of the next value as part of the current value calculation the iteration through the values skips the first write hence the additional write after the loop to ensure all values are accounted for
i had same hostname for both master and slave so i changed their hostname to master and slave respectively by editing their respective etc hostname files
since i already had entry for master and slave in etc hosts file i didnt get any error
sqoop currently do not exposes any java api and thus such usage is not supported
i would expect that you see the deprecation because you are using exporttool class from package com cloudera sqoop tool whereas the functionality was moved to package org apache sqoop tool and the original instance was left there for backward compatibility
so table a has n buckets table b has n buckets too so you can mergesort bucket 1 of a with bucket 1 of b 2 with 2 etc
since you are using hadoop2 you need to remove the first dependency of org apache mrunit
you need to remove one of your final two dependencies depending on the version of hadoop you are using keep the dependency with the corresponding classfier hadoop1 or hadoop2 and remove the other
leaving this question and answer up in case anybody else encounters this not very informative error message and because i stand by my stupidity
described use case of moving data from relational database oracle in this case to hadoop ecosystem hive in this case is the purpose of sqoop tool so this can be definitely achieved
you did not attached the error that you are getting so it s really hard to help
you are facing this problem because the plugin is missing some necessary jars
therefore we will have a loop that looks like see we extracted the year and temp from each line in the file and stored them in a special dictionary object
if you have something like the store name and total sales from the store as intermediate result from the mapper you can use the following as reducer to find out the maximum sales and which store has the maximum sales
so when pig tries to call the avg function and it checks to see which version of it to use since it must behave differently if the field is an int rather than a double for example it cannot tell how to proceed
i went a checked the hdfs default xml in the src folder and found this i think i am using old version of hadoop because dfs safemode threshold pct is deprecatd
hadoop will decide number of mappers based on input s size
check the version of hadoop in your pom xml once and build hbase accordingly
checking this link might help you click here and if it doesn t solve may be you have redundant guava jars lying around in the classpath that s causing this exception
p s since you already have hadoop configured and it is running fine you can run hbase in pseudo distributed setup
this will be another approach 2 is the datatime position change it accordingly
from top of my head something like this could work but needs testing of cause here if one event is at 12 03 45 and another at 12 03 59 these would be in the same group and 12 04 45 with 12 05 00 would be in different groups
the second reducer would have a job id job 201302272236 0002 so it would take 2000 2999
i think the reason why this works is because in pseudo distributed mode each child process of the task tracker has its own jvm and it is better to set the property of child jvm
as documents don t have the url field therefore the id of the documents empty so its throwing a null pointer exception when it runs the below method
if that is taken up as a value in the map key value function i think you might have memory issues since you task have can use only 200mb and you have a record in memory which is of 350mb
for that you need to set issplittable in your inputformat to false so that your input file is read as a whole and goes to just one mapper
after some investigation i find the problem is my column type is integer so the longcolumninterpreter getvalue method returns null
from your code and result i am sure that your info hits column is a string column but not a long column
double check what username whirr uses while setting up a new node i suspect its using the ubuntu default username and hence is not able to ssh into the rhel node
ported code to use the multiprocessing module internally hadoop assigns as many mappers as there are cores in the cluster hence multiprocessing is not the way to go if you need speed up
beeswax should be running as the hue user by default https github com cloudera hue blob master desktop core src desktop supervisor py l67 so it need to be writable by hue
because i have earlier seen several issues that s because of firewall blocking important ports
this is mainly because hadoop resolves puplic ips to ec2 internal ips which breaks mr jobs submission and hdfs management
in the employee class remove system out println employee id is input readint and from reason the system out println employee id is input readint already deserializes your first input and that s why using input readint again is causing the issue
probable reason you are not outputting anything from the mapper for the reducers to run at the first place
for example to use 2 reducers you can do regarding your second question i agree with you that sort k1 1 will do the trick so i don t see the problem either
in your etc hosts what configuration you have make 127 0 1 1 localhost on hbase client because of this ip s you are facing this problem
how can i include information from the hdfs path namely org and suborg in my dir structure example so that it is query able in hive
it sounds like you want something more procedural to load a small amount of data do some processing make a decision based on that and follow that algorithm to completion
load is inappropriate here because load does not return a bag it returns a relation that pig expects you to put through some transformations
in your example there re 2 group by must cause 2 kinds of shuffle
and mr shuffles data based on a key
a single mr job cannot shuffle data two ways based on two different keys
the script is doing two group by operations which will hence result in two mr jobs
however when you replace group by with filter pig will implicitly replace filter with split to do multi query optimization which will result in a single mr job
based on the api you are using you have to keep change the map and reduce classes using setmapperclass and setreducerclass and submit job
i ve documented the root cause and solution here
load the line in its entirety as one chararray then pass that into a udf that does all the parsing returning the result
i like this better than writing a custom storage function since i think it is a bit easier
this is transparent to both of them so the output is compressed and uncompressed automatically
i think he she must have been saying that hadoop must uncompress that compressed input for you since the reducer is not expecting compressed data that it has to uncompress itself
i think you have to set the virtual machine options this is for both map and reduce tasks mapred child java opts xmx7000m if you have the new api supported you can specify it for the mapper only with mapreduce map java opts xmx7000m i had similar problems and also logged the virtual machine heapsizes more in this small blog post about checking java heap sizes note that also reducers are running on a node so they might compete for memory make sure to limit the number of reduce slots as well if necessary
please let me know this is unclear since i have seen this problem posted quite a few times without suitable resolution
also since i am writing java code to access the hbase instance in the vm there was no need to use thrift or rest the java api was sufficient
the reason is you did not configure your core site xml correctly with the attribute fs default name
i assume your error is due to classpath issue because you have a java lang noclassdeffounderror you should include your yarn classes in your java library path
it may be done with contextual menu through add library or something like that depending on how formatted are your libraries jar class etc
i m not sure what was initially causing the problem be it a bug in writableutils some incompatibility with compressed integer byte arrays or a faulty understanding of how this stuff works on my part
in the newer mapreduce recordreader implementations this information is not provided by the rr class but rather it is part of the fsinputstream implementations thus with the new mapreduce api the recordreader was abstracted to not necessarily return a getpos
you will have to determine which key values depno are heavily skewed and declare it accordingly in the ddl read the linked article for details go over the comments and changes of hive 3086
based on the command line it seems that you are using sqoop 1 x whereas the jdbc driver is in path for sqoop2
i would recommend to copy the jar file mysql connector java 5 1 6 jar to usr lib sqoop lib instead so that it s available for sqoop 1
the hadoop plugin configuration file only considers the first directory so you have to add the following code to build xml change the eclipse sdk jars this allowed me to build successfully and create the needed jar file
to get the same effect you can split it into two steps
you can initialize class variables like that in the constructor of your udf in your script use the following line with this method your matrix must be stored on hdfs so that the mappers or reducers which are getting initialized and calling the constructor will have access to the data
if you are using the older mapreduce api then do this if you are using the new mapreduce api then do this reason the reason for this is that your mapreduce application might be using textinputformat as the inputformat class and this class generates keys of type longwritable and values of type text by default
reduced tasktracker memory to 256m and limited the number of tasktrackers to 1 per node anything higher causes child errors and takes more time for mapreduce job to run
it s probably a permissions issue where your user account doesn t have the privileges to write things in that directory
the best way to try tutorial codes is step 1 clean your class path for hadoop and cascading which may cause conflicts
step 2 install required dependencies with gradle default building tool in impatient project step 3 you d better use ide eclipse http eclipse org or intellij idea because the impatient project added idea and eclipse plugin by default
if you using this lib org apache commons logging logfactory then you should probably initialize log according to classes coding example private static log log logfactory getlog classname class it has class extension when compile you should make sure whether that class created or not else it will give an exception i guess check the classpath too issue java lang noclassdeffounderror root cause incorrect java path set in environment variable section solution set correct java home path steps environment variable setting my comp right click properties env variable advance tab variable create new java home environment variable
however i ve never had the need to look up variable keys in a pig map and this other so question doesn t have an answer so you ll need to do some trial and error to make it work you could also try using pig s top function instead of order limit
here is the raw code i am confused because in a simple cat program i had to set compression codec
the reason why i am suggesting this is i was facing a similar problem where loadincrementalhfiles loads the files into hbase and deletes it from the output folder but still tries to read the hfile from the output folder that could be why you are seeing timeout while waiting for channel to be ready for read
mapper being run resulting in stacktrace above is mahout s canopymapper and not custom one you ve written
you didn t state so i m guessing that you re using more than one mr job in a data flow pipeline
sqoop 1 do not have official java api and thus there is no official documentation how to do it
we ve seen a lot of people requesting for such api and thus we ve added it in sqoop 2
in addition i m not sure why you re trying to check that because you re doing a left outer join there won t be any records in x without a corresponding record in readstagingdata
i guess it s either because your field delimiter set in hive create statement is not set to a right one so field read in buffer exceeded maximum allowed length
you ve mentioned that you ve installed the sqoop via tarbals and not packages so you will need to alter catalina properties file
use edit your catalina properties file with absolute paths for loading hadoop libraries because sometime relative path is not work properly in my case
because it occurs only when native jar file is missing or thirdparty jar file not supported by your current environment
just executed my visual studio project and its running may be i will struck at some other point due to lack of dashboard and web api
1 change the port to 8021 for your properties file and any other file setting that depends on the jobtracker port or 2 change the jobtracker port back to 8021
if you are running other services that depend on the jobtracker port go ahead and stop and restart them too
it means that the jobtracker is not running or not listening on port 8021 for some reason
since hortonworks had a win implementation for 1 3 of their product i downloaded it and extracted the file out of the msi file
the job launched the map task are given so there may be some prob with the i p file
you might want to try grouping by the year since that is what you are selecting
i think if did use fs fs filesystem get conf then we might have had to go through and make sure that each one of those fs are closed since each time we d call get it would return a new instance
because the jvm stack size was too small change your mr jvm stack size because the jvm stack size was too small change your mr jvm stack size fg mapred child java opts xms2048m xmx4096m
i m a coauthor and don t mind recommending it to you since i think it directly addresses your points mahout apis hadoop steps to implementing a recommender
then once the namenode starts it has no datanodes checked in therefore it cannot find the node on which the block of data being accessed is located
hadoop requires this so it can send your code up to hdfs jobtracker
in your case i imagine you haven t bundled up your job classes into a jar and then run the program from the jar resulting in a cnfe
the custom split approach is not suitable to this scenario for the following 2 reasons
1 entire file is getting loaded to the map node because the map function needs entire file as value entire content
though the sequencefileoutputformat was after it so i would think that value would be used
because of that the ip layer is number two in the chain
the cause when you run your job directly in the eclipse in fact it works as local mode which means that the application will try to find the files in your client machine
exec java exec target generated sources org apache drill exec expr holders bigintholder java there is a problem in that the maven import into eclipse results in target generated sources org being added to the source folder build path
it could be tested by changing the code to this code should cause a character by character hex printout of the input string
while exporting from text file the number of columns will be determined by the number of separators present on the line
based on provided example it seems that the target table have 2 columns whereas the third line have zero separators and thus it s assume that it s one single column
this discrepancy would cause sqoop to fail
i was trying to use a non external table so i can take advantage of partitioning but apparently it s possible to partition even an external table as explained here
above tmp jetty 0 0 0 0 50090 secondary __ y6aanv is a directory at org apache hadoop mapred localjobrunner job run localjobrunner java 354 caused by java io filenotfoundexception tmp jetty 0 0 0 0 50090 secondary __ y6aanv jetty 0 0 0 0 50090 secondary __ y6aanv is a directory which is in the input path directory
the number of maps you d get doesn t depend on the number of regions you have in the table but rather how the data is split into regions each region contains a range of keys
since you mention that all your new data start with the same prefix it is likely it only fit into a few regions
you can pre split your table so that the new data would be divided between more regions
i found conflicting jars in my classpath which i cleaned and since then i have had no problems
that said this is one of the reasons why it makes sense to use aws native hadoop offerings like emr and qubole
this is problem is due to the reason that the tool talend searches the default database
hence give database tablename in the table field
you must create a soft link for folder that has java in it so check before this command cd usr lib jvm ln s java 7 openjdk amd64 jdk in above step as u might have seen in the tutorial change as following the 7 here is dependent on verion of jdk u have so check that and change accordingly
this is error due to java home variable
i don t know the reasons but hive restricts creating an external table only in local mode
all my java mappers extend a base mapper that has the following code so that i never get bitten by that problem
in the custom data type include setting both the values you want and override the compareto method so that hadoop can internally compare them and sort them
this can be caused by for hadoop version 0 20 check if you set up your environment correctly see pentaho support creating a new hadoop configuration check on hdfs if you have an opt pentaho mapreduce and check folder permissions on hdfs for opt pentaho did you find the kettle jar files in lib folder
it is an incompatiblity error between hadoop 1 2 1 and the cloud ⁹ lib version 1 5 0 since higher versions of hadoop 2 x use a taskattemptcontext interface instead of class
i think the error you are getting is because your namenode is not listening to port 9000 which you have configured in your given code
it sounds like one key has the bulk of your records so they can only be processed by a single reducer
add a random number or string to your key in order to distribute to multiple reducers on the first pass then merge those results on a second pass
yes like any good code hadoop handles ioexception but it may or may not finish job successfully after the io error depending on your answer to my question 1 2
it may be reassigning the value on the second declaration would have to see code to tell but in general naming convention you want to stay away from that not only because of issues your running into but for readability for yourself and others that may be working on the same project
however as a practice the job names should uniquely identify the job so that when you are looking up a job and intend to kill it you don t end up killing wrong job
again you mentioned my algorithm runs different mr jobs depending upon the data sets so i m left to assume that a dataset gets to be used only by one pair of mapper reducer class
they are not meaningfully comparable to numbers so there is no right sort order for them
the sort of thing that can lead to a nan is calculating the arithmetic mean of an empty set by dividing the total value by the number of elements
a distributed apache hbase installation depends on a running zookeeper cluster it will start and stop the zookeeper ensemble as part of the hbase start stop process
you may not have installed the java sdk alternatively you may need to specify the location of that sdk in your local environment variables see for example https confluence atlassian com display doc setting the java home variable in windows after doing that you may need to restart the hdinsight apache services depending on how your machine is configured but will definitely need to restart your command prompt to get the new environment
so amend your code to the following the old api doesn t pass you the outputcollector for you to write out any final or accumulated values so you ll need to cache the value passed to the map method in an instance variable for your mapper
now there might be other characters like spaces that can cause the query to return 0 results
as far as i know this problem stems from missing cascading scheme class in your classpath thereby throwing this exception during the runtime
i spoke to aws and they said that my only option at the moment is to stick with hive as msck repair table has some issues when addressing a table located in s3 which is the reason why they added the alter table recover partition command
it looks like my specific problem was due to trying to calculate the min and the max in one piglatin line
this is because the incorrect configuration for service my hbase1 my hbase
two different mistakes leads to my problems 1 for every core site xml file of 3 slaves the value of fs default name means the namenode s ip address thus all should be the ip address of master but what i write is each slave s ip address
so when i use start all sh in the master each slave is trying to connect to its own port 9000 instead of the master s since the slave is running as datanode instead of namenode so connection is refused
2 after i modified the ip address for core site xml for 3 slaves although every slave becomes trying to connect to the master s port 9000 but connection is still refused i run sudo netstat ntlp on the master it shows this 127 0 0 1 means that it is only listening to connection on 9000 which is from lcoalhost all the connection on 9000 from outside cannot be received so problem goes to file etc hosts my ect hosts file is below since i am using ip address in the config file so in such a configuration file ip address 192 168 10 12 will be translated to host name localhost and i run host localhost it show localhost has address 127 0 0 1 so such a configuration will leads to hadoop will only listening to 127 0 0 1 9000
because hive is seamlessly working with hdfs files
hbase has this weird issue in some x64 ubuntu machines disconnecting from internet will help in resolving this issue after startup you can connect to the internet
second get results of first
then write that result to a file in hdfs
this is simply due to the cardinality of most natural languages
if for some reason you are getting a ton of words out of wordcount i e you aren t doing it on natural language have two mapreduce jobs wordcount counts all the words pretty much the example exactly topn a mapreduce job that finds the top n of something here are some examples source code blog post have the output of wordcount write to hdfs
the reason you need two jobs is you are doing two aggregations one is word count and the second is topn
there is no guarantee that the same reducer will all the name time pairs corresponding to the same name hence there is no guarantee that the values for bob are processed in time order
from the exception i got it originated from tableinputformatbase getsplits when i analyze source code of tableinputformatbase it is looking for a job configuration parameter hbase nameserver address
i was able to run it and it indeed had a version missmatch plus this jobtracker api error call to localhost 127 0 0 1 50030 failed on local exception java io eofexception because i was trying to connect to port 50030 when i should connect to port 9001 as described in that thread
you need to specify your class path in place of hadoop classpath such as the exact path depends on where you installed hadoop
because you commented out these two lines perhaps
the bam toolbox has following artifacts stream definitions analytics dashboard components the analytics has the hive scripts and those depend on underlying database used for the wso2bam datasource if you look at wso2bam 2 4 0 samples toolboxes you will see there multiple toolboxes depending on the database
check those particularly and by the way since your keys are always fixed to a constant you don t need to create them for each emit from your map function
be careful not to put space after the b s i o characters because i have found that it makes a difference with and without space it worked for me only without space
it is correct to use toolrunner to run the job which processes the generic options followed by job specific options and hence solving the problem
okay problem was in my script commands as i was not passing two inputs that resulted in the error of out of bounds access while acessing the second field register hdfs 0 0 0 0 8020 user training pig pow jar base load hdfs 0 0 0 0 8020 user training pig base using pigstorage as id int base int exponent load hdfs 0 0 0 0 8020 user training pig exponents using pigstorage as id int exp int tab join base by id exponent by id tab2 foreach tab generate 1 as base 3 as exp fin foreach tab2 generate abc power base exp as res dump fin final java code enter code here
because it should point to something like main method where you instantiate your applicationcontext instance
there must be something else which is causing this
the reason is probably the newline character difference in unix and in windows
this is because bytes tolong method do not check whether the retrieved byte is null or not and call its byte length which will throw your exception
the result is it re write on the previous line with the same first primary key
this is to prevent ambiguity caused by things like what does the third b refer to
these are the names of columns in the result set not variables
its not possible because the query attempts to use the alias before it was defined
the only clause where you can refer to column aliases assigned in the select is order by since it s the only clause that is evaluated after the select clause
for future reference here is problem due to hosts file edit the file and remove this entry after removing it works fine
i feel this query can be modified to obtain the result in a better way
reason for your error is that class does not exist
you hive site xml generally hive conf dir hive site xml is not well formed hence can t be parsed and understood by hue
since your replication factor is 3 hdfs would try to place 1 whole copy on a single datanode and distribute the rest across all the datanodes
1 change the replication factor to 1 since you are only trying to benchmark reducing replication should not be a big issue
if not hdfs will tend to place most of the data in this node since it would have reduced latency
in mapreduce you cannot afford to hold all the records in memory cause it will never scale
all you want is to separate out the records based on patent no so why not leverage the sorting of mapreduce framework
write your partitioner to partition only on the basis of country
as a result all the records with same country would go to same reducer and sorted by patent no and name
thus you get rid of any in memory treemap
but you should always try to use memory as low as possible so that the java s garbage collection should be called less frequently
the most likely reason for this is that you re running an old version of hadoop that exposed a difference interface in programdriver
i found out why it took so much time at the end in fact i thought that the command hadoop fs expunge allows me to empty the trash but it doesn t so when hadoop tried to write in hdfs files the result it was very slow because there was a very little space left
as a suggestion you can use the third signature which is simpler since you don t need do call addnamedoutput and can just write to any baseoutputpath
hyphen is one among the reserved keywords in pig and hence the error
as map reduce paradigm can process solve analyze problems which were almost impossible to be processed by single machine the reason its called big data
and than you can perform another mr algorithm on that result
the reason for performing the map and reduce jobs directly on the machine where data is stored is the locality and therefore lower network traffic
you can afterwards combine the reduced results and reduce them again
however machine 2 actually wouldn t send the data anywhere this result would rather be save as a preliminary result in hdfs and other machines can access it
this mr jobs are run on all the nodes of such a database cluster and the results are stored in the database again and all of this without hadoop and hdfs
you don t have permission since you are not logged in as root and trying to play with the files owned by root
if you see log file output twice that s probably the reason
so you may not throw parseexception from your reduce function because your exception clause does not allow that
this might be the reason of ambiguity error being thrown by your parser
try to double check that descriptor option d l 3 n 5 c n 2 c n c n is fitting your data well because descriptorexception bad token token can throw if descriptor not found for some column in csv
there is a possibility it cannot find the jar on the datanode and hence gives an error check the mapreduce logs you would find the reason if this is a issue one workaround can be to put the file in hdfs and copy it to local filesytem on the datanode during execution
the bashrc is only read by a shell that is non login otherwise is read bash profile so you could set to read bashrc from bash profile see here what s the difference between bashrc bash profile and environment
this also has the added bonus of using the local configuration so you don t have to change your code when switching between a hadoop and a local file structure
it is because the necessary packages are not included in javac classpath
the above mentioned tutorial could however mislead you to point hadoop classpath to the wrong lib directory there are distinct ones for the jdk and the jre thus missing tools jar
it would cause error could not find or load main class com sun tools javac main at compile time
found the reason for this error i executed the netstat on the ports 80 2181 3181 and found the following netstat nlp grep 3181 tcp 0 0 0 0 0 0 3181 0 0 0 0 listen 4106 patrolagent the reason for the issue was due to system kernel error
the port was bound already and not released so the processes were dead but port was not released
you will have to add the jars to distributedcache so that they are available to the mapper at run time
so it turned out to be as simple as not restarting all the hadoop deamons after changing the classpath
your files should be put in hdfs for this code to run or because your are using genericoptionsparse you can use this format hadoop jar jarname jar drivername files file1 file2 should work for you
so that shows the partition got appended not overwritten dropped
all the edits are discarded by the cluster because you didn t pass throught the namenode
so that it will fetch new api
you don t have a jar and so that method for distributing the proper classes falls apart
this can be achieved by either raising a bug in apache jira different for 4 modules hdfs mapreduce yarn common in your case it is mapreduce so the url https issues apache org jira browse mapreduce can be used need to create an account for raising issues or send out a mail to apache mapreduce developers mailing list mapreduce dev hadoop apache org
based on the discussion you can submit your code changes as a patch file
it appears that you re setting hive home and then passing the full path in the hive site xml resulting in the incorrect path that you see in your error output
print statements in mapper or reduce method will not appear in main job output for viewing the output use jobtracker webui choose the correct jobid from jobid column click on map reduce from kind column click on respective map reduce task click on all tasklog clolumn since you are using the class de l3s boilerpipe boilerpipeprocessingexception in mapper method you need to make this class available in distributed manner for that if you are exeuting this application using hadoop command make use of libjars generic option need to implement toolrunner class or simply pack the jar containing the class de l3s boilerpipe boilerpipeprocessingexception along with the main jar itself
the thrift protocol version is also different depending depending on the release
you need to add all the jars which you are using outside the jar in which your driver map reduce code resides so that they are available to the mapper at runtime
8088 is default used by yarn resourcemanager webapp address you can check this doc for more detailed https hadoop apache org docs current hadoop yarn hadoop yarn common yarn default xml so you can try changing port in yarn resourcemanager webapp address or yarn resourcemanager address
this solution works because there is no nesting within json and is a valid json end delimiter as per the given example
after analyzing datanode s container logs i have found the reason why these errors
for example as for libcrypto so 10 ubuntu has this library but fedora hasn t so the error occurs slave couldn t find the accurate library
you may also need to specify the property mapred local dir in that xml file
due to which hive metastore service was not running
depending on how you installed hadoop you will need to also add user y to the hadoop user group that x is in
i think it is probably big and the process is not terminating because it hasn t actually finished copying the file yet
i have tried this using the following curl command and had success it resulted in the expected http 100 continue 307 for the redirect and put and 201 created
i suspect that some combination of the above issues caused the url to be truncated or something in which a put was inappropriate for the received url and or operation parameter
what about using macros growth pig then create a shell script findchanges sh so that you ll end up having this will create the result under changes 2009 04 01 2009 09 30
after the cross product you end up with data like at this point you need to satisfy four conditionals where field matches id one and two from the self join don t match so you don t get back the same id intersecting with itself start time from second group being compared should be greater than start time for first group and less then end time for first group this code should work might have a syntax error somewhere as i couldn t test it but should help you to write what you need
if you look into the exception you can see that the namenode is in safe mode so the crunch job can t write any new files into hdfs
keyin valuein for the mapper and keyout valueout for the reducer depend on your input output formats respectively
it all depends on your data
you generally use more mappers than reducers so you can leverage more parallelism
however reducers have all values collocated based on key so the processing may make sense there too
or if the data has to be normalized for some reason the mapreduce hive requires them to be basically be in one table
in that case you would do etl and move data from hdfs to rdbms such as mysql infobright and use reporting out of the rdbms
you need to modify schema xml each document should have one unique id as per your need you need to store only path for htmlcontent other fields index only for searching 3 you can use post jar to post all xml files to solr or you can use solrj apis if you need programmatically fields to be stored or not fields on which you want to perform just search no need store unless you want to display them in result
by doing following i am successfully running my jws on tomcat this is required because the jars should be there in war in deployment
this was a blunder because i am newbie to java
the reason why you are not able to execute the script is f option is missing execute the script as follows since hive internally uses hadoop for keeping its data and mapreduce for execution
so depending on what type is emitted by accountcounterreducer you ll need to select an output that matches that type
this happens because your list has one element size 1 and you ask for the second element index 1 indexing starts from zero
the hive error just says the job failed you need to know what error caused that failure
i found the solution to this problem i have a variable length header in my input fixed length file which was not skipped so the position was not exactly starting at the beginning of a record instead it was starting at position startofrecord headerlength
that leads to skew which leads to slowness
if it still times out restart service on that node that you suspect is causing the issue
in most cases you ll want rpc address to be the internal ip but this potentially breaks cassandra s hadoop client which is determining endpoints to talk to based on broadcast address
it respects the consistency level on the actual write but in our case it never got there due to 1
because if they are not present in the value the left and right variables become 1
and therefore you get an stringindexoutofboundsexception so the code you should change is something like this
this is documented in the following ticket with workaround below https issues apache org jira browse hdfs 5587 issue in my case was that sshd and some other users existed in both the ldap and local box but the uids did not match
first of all the proper way is to output the result of reducer to files hbase tables using context write
please note that each reducer will create its own stdout in task logs so you may need to check result for all reducers
on the other hand i would store data in rdbms because from time to time you will need to reindex solr to add some new functionality to the index
this problem is caused by the fact that the new parameter fs defaultfs isn t supported in this version
as a consequence your core site xml should have the following property you don t have to change that value in your hadoop server though just in the file readed by the api
even if that is not true you would be helped by adding a timestamp field of some sort to your document and using the correct bson date object type as shown below this allows you to use the mongodb aggregation framework as it can operate on date objects of this type in order to break down the results to discrete days that not only gives you the results in the fastest way mongodb can do it but that timestamp value is also useful for filtering queries within date ranges which is something you cannot easily do from other values
after that i would make sure of the following things regionserver hotspotting uneven key space distribution can lead to a huge number of requests to a single region bombarding the regionserver process causing slow response time
non local data regions perhaps your job is requesting data which is not local to the datanode regionservers run on datanodes thus forcing hdfs to request data blocks from other servers over the network involves network traffic as well
i think you have to change your print statements so they end with a comma from the official python documentation
produces the following result notice that there are two records for dhoni this is because he scored 150 twice
if you want to remove that you need to choose the earliest or latest year depending on what you want
i would do it using the top function http pig apache org docs r0 11 0 func html topx here is the script to obtain the result you want as a result you will get
there are some issues in writing to mongodb from pig especially when you use hortonworks windows distribution
i had a similar error and it could be due to hive metastore hms not being able to come up
you can be sure about the stringpair avsc file is in your jar by if it s not listed maven can simply build it into the jar if you place it under the src main resources stringpair avsc for the no content to map to object due to end of input error message the magic was for me to place a slash before the file name because it is in the root of the jar
it because of using hadoop command to format namenode it deprecated by hadoop2 2 0
the basic format would look something like this this will return the results from each run of the query appended to each other with a column called iter specifying which iteration the result comes from
because the password in datasource is the wrong one in my situation
because the password in datasource is the wrong one in my situation so it give such error
there was package mismatch due to which this error was coming
in your code you combined both mrv1 and mrv2 due to which you got the error

the number of map tasks run on an instance depends on the ec2 instance type
a disadvantage is that setting this value too high can cause the ec2 instances in your cluster to run out of memory
note i had only used nltk package not yaml so my answer will only focus on loading nltk package not yaml but i believe it should work for your question as well
ans because we will provide path to this mod zipped file through command line we don t need to worry much about it
second changes in your mapper or py file third and most the important one i guess you might be missing is command line argument to run map reduce thus above step solved my problem and i think it should solve others as well
i suppose it depends on case whether it is better to read it in once create two outputs and read in again or read in twice
just add the classnotfoundexception to the run method signature the reason you get an error when you try and try catch it is because if there is a classnotfoundexception thrown during execution there will be no return value and the method has to return something
when yarn starts it reads hive 0 11 jar files which lead to the error
i meet this problem server times when i deploy hadoop secure mode with kerberos they are caused by the same reason addresses are not set in fqdn fully qualified domain name
it actually depends on whats the requirement and what set of skills you have
based on the available skill set which will fit for your requirements you can decide
i ve never used amazon emr so i don t know how it works and don t know if you need other jars packaged or not or if you need an specific version
changing your mapper definition to following wold get you running since you are anyways not using the key of mapper so rest of your logic remains the same
if the version of your impala service is 1 1 or earlier the upgrade will cause the non uvailability of impala so you need to upgrade the impala as well to 1 2 1 or later
since you are doing map side join the mapper gets on table as input and another table is read completely by each mapper
now for 100k records in each this may work but at 200k records i think based on size of each record the jvm might face memory issues
thus what you should do is as follows cd to the mahout bin directory vi mahout find the line mahout local true and change it to mahout local true source mahout then it should work on local now
therefore you had to configure the dhcp on both the server and clients sides
since these blocks are distributed onto different nodes these mappers also run on different nodes
since these tasks run in parallel it makes a good candidate for computation intensive tasks
reason is that the module geoip database is not installed on all the hadoop nodes
i suspect that the disk of that data node is malfunctioning thus the data read from that disk is corrupt and the decoder couldn t handle the invalid input data
if you have created a table in hive with the number of result fields from the above sql then you can simply do as from select it is your query
therefore the string array can go from split 0 to split 3 only instead of split 4
json tuple worked in the guide because it made your string into a map
i m not sure enough but you should try this note if you want your custom classpath to override the original class path you should set the environment variable hadoop user classpath first to true so that the hadoop classpath value specified in hadoop user env sh is first
this leads to incorrect execution of the remaining code and final output is wrong
in that case create a fat jar by adding dependent jars in your jar myjar jar or use hadoop libjars option need to override toolrunner class in your main class
there are a bunch of simple reasons why the daemons have trouble starting can t find java home can t find hadoop home etc
there is no root cause
i suspect my upgrade to either eclipse luna or upgrade of xcode causes the error but have no proof
not a very good root cause but i have not experience the problem again
i found a similar issue to this when installing elasticsearch in my case it was caused by a combination of an egress filtering firewall and no proxy being set
you can always keep track of the file rownumber as well so you can reference all the original attributes later if you want
the first is that you may have something like in your script somewhere because the value is being treated as the environment variable
you re using src so you need the but you re setting obj so it doesn t need the
in other words you can do things like i think this is actually what you re doing based on the error message and one of your comments to this answer which includes spaces in the export command
decrease these parameters to 6gb and decrease heap sizes accordingly
so you could easily hit a situation when you launch tree applicationmasters for three different jobs that would hang there forever because you don t have any containers left to perform the actual map reduce processing
further on you should limit the number of applications that can be run in parallell on your cluster because you don t have that many resources to 2 or 3
i ve find the reason
tasktrackers can t run job task map because jar file is not in distributed cash
flush the table location hbase data default mytable col1 repeat the step 2 and 3 one more time and observe the location we can see two files in that location
now execute the below command now we can see only one file in that location
the problem is because the object taskattemptcontext is a interface in the version 2 4 of hadoop and the job was expecting a class version 1 1 2 hadoop
get the jar loaded on all the nodes at hive and map reduce path like the below location so that hive and map reduce component will pick this whenever it s been called
it is hard to say because i do not know where you set the parameters
i was using internal table for store so it was not working as expected
this error can occur if the necessary jarfiles are not readable by the user running the hdfs command or are misplaced so that they can t be found by hadoop libexec hadoop config sh
your problem is due to the fact that your pig script tries to connect to the cluster and that failes call from gianluca aspire s3 391 127 0 1 1 to localhost 9000 failed on connection exception java net connectexception connection refused that s in the log files
now the cause of that problem is that your cluster runs on yarn while your pig script expects the older mr1 jobtracker running on port 9000
quite some time has passed since you where asking the question but you are adding the wrong object to the jobcontrol
i am suggesting this because hadoop itself do this if last line of any mapper is incomplete
the error is due to you are initializing marks and names arrays to null and not initialize them properly
you are referring to a null array variable parts so you are getting this error change your code as i mentioned below it could work
i found the reason here
alex s answer seems a bit more complex than required a simple use case since public void write keyout key valueout value string baseoutputpath is available
since the file is in tmp it could have been deleted by a temp cleaning cron job maybe by rebooting the system or someone doing rm tmp
do share the result
hadoop is a beast to master deploy administrate but it brings scalability fault tolerance because a very limited paradigm
note that hadoop will try to replicate the blocks of the file as soon as they get written in the first node and since the default value for replication is 3 it will fail to access other nodes if you only have one node cluster
the jps command on hadoop now returns the expected results including namenode
based on the exception that you are facing i guess that you did not install oracle s jdbc driver
here s the thing what i was trying to do is installing the hdp enviroment in windows server using powershell and since i m not very good at it i make dumb errors
you are getting that result because unix timestamp gives the current timestamp
it does not make sense to write even more remarks so i will rather refine my answer here as i gather more information from vimlesh
there are a lot of open questions i do not know how many classes the aspect is being applied to how many threads there are in the app server and what happens with memory consumption in the 10 minutes before and the time after the jmx results are no longer displayed
only captures method executions in classes directly under package com foo but not in any sub packages so it is useless to exclude classes from sub packages
you have misunderstood my answer in the other question because you did not choose one of my solutions to exclude the aspect and its internally used anonymous threadlocal subclass but concatenated all of them with
you try to exclude call com sflow jmx sflowagent but for two reasons it is not necessary firstly sflowagent is not in the targetted package com foo
secondly an execution joinpoint can never be a call joinpoint at the same time so the intersection set must be empty no need to exclude the calls from the executions
without an sscce it is really hard to diagnose the problem s root cause
therefore is illegal cause you re not calling r functions here but extracting the values think function declaration
the reason for the error is a missing pair of round brackets
turns out that there was a condition where i was generating the same file name due to a tuple parsing error
i was getting the alreadybeingcreatedexception for that exact reason
i ve found an answer for the latter error with a workaround based on two variables export export libjars avrojar1 avrojar2 jar3 export hadoop classpath avrojar1 avrojar2 jar3 and then running the hadoop jar command with libjars libjars
i am using virtualbox so i had to reinstall the whole operation system and hadoop
if you can find your jar by lsing to it and it was properly built usually this error is cause by incorrectly putting quotes around the path to the jar
the issue arrise because when add a user in the same group then it decreases the permissions of ssh folder and its child files so after adding new user just increase the permission of ssh folder by sudo chmod r 700 ssh then ssh localhost will work fine
hence i undeleted the question and answered it
also i have edited the question to highlight the actual cause
if this code is running in a map or reduce method as it seems because you have a context instance then you are executing on one of your slave nodes
instead use start dfs sh and start yarn sh so you should use start dfs sh and start yarn sh
so in that case your query will look like this hope it helps
you need to cast the date to be compared as date using cast your date as date since it is currently a string
since hadoop streaming is just shoveling work through stdin to a command line executable you can just run java test on your test class like you would locally
i ran this successfully myself using your code selimn is right that this is a pretty odd way to go about it though since you could just as well be writing a native java mapper
the problem was that i actually was getting to the data but one of my external jars had been built with java 8 and lines does not exists in a bufferedreader in java 7 i m running java 7 hence the error
root cause main database and temporary scrat database were created by different users
your compareto is flawed it will totally fail the sort algorithm because you seem to break transivity in your ordering
because hdfs schema is registered in hadoop hdfs jar so you can t just use hadoop core jar alone
here error is not clear it could be because of permission xml validations etc
looks like because of some issues you are not able to start namenode using hdfs command
as you can see the error is coming due to the hive default xml please have a look at this file
there might be a white space or any other text at the starting of the xml file which is causing the error you can refer this question on stackoverflow org xml sax saxparseexception content is not allowed in prolog which has the same error as you got just for a different file hive default xml template is located in the conf directory in your installation root
instead of using hadoop command you may use mapred jar or yarn jar command also depends on the mapreduce framework classic or yarn your are having
since you are saying that you have 20 or so of this 20140811 directories why don t you try creating an external table with partitions on those directories and run your queries on a single partition
either a misconfiguration or a conflicting configuration that caused the issue
this is because the compiler substitutes no generics for object so a compareto taking only compositekeys does not override it
in that case you should check your core site xml for the hdfs settings fs defaultfs
since you are using the default hive metastore embedded derby
i think the problem is there because you are not using the full class name
this means you ve picked up a version built against hadoop 1 x hence the jobcontroller class vs interface exception
but since the file size if large this would long
here is the source code for the function btw http grepcode com file repo1 maven org maven2 com twitter parquet pig 1 2 0 parquet pig tuplewritesupport java it seems fine to me but sounds like this could be a bug in this case the t get i returns a string and hence the
no k means ever will give you the result american football as a topic
since every value is close to 0 02 your results may have degenerated to a near random mess
i think the problem is in line your map produces a pair of text and text then your combiner takes it and produces a pair of text and intwritable but your reducer can t accept intwritable as value so it throws an exception
i also suggest defining the port in the value so the value would be hdfs master 8020
sorry i m not linux guru so i don t know about nmap but does telnet ing work from slave to master to the port
capacity is measured in of events while rollsize in actual bytes so it is difficult to properly correlate those two
however you can extend one and feed matched files to different mapper types based on your criteria
because primary or foreign keys are informational only in netezza it s not an invalid state to have data that doesn t conform to the primary key definition
similarly while earlier versions of netezza didn t offer explicit transaction control within stored procedures every stored procedure was implicitly its own transaction when outside of a begin commit and in that case a transaction is still either fully committed on completion or fully rolled back on an abort thereby maintaining atomicity
the newer behavior where commits are allowed in a store procedure does give rise to different behavior though
thus if there are 100 regions in the table there will be 100 map tasks for the job regardless of how many column families are selected in the scan
however i do not know the root cause but it s not related to permissions
more on hive permissions other suggestion based on other answers and comments here if you want to see the permissions on some hdfs path or file hdfs dfs ls is not your friend to know more about the permissions and its old school approach
you can use hdfs dfs getfacl hdfs path will give you the complete details result looks something like below
first command generate the function which it calls will depend on the input parameter size
second command index null pointer exception is due to input parameter shape
ps i couldn t comment hence i added as answer note
pig doesn t output sequence files by default so you have a couple options output sequence files from your pig job for your mr job storing data to sequencefile from apache pig figure out what file format pig outputs by default and read that maybe it s plaintext
this is depend on your program that which type of function you are used
hence there are permission discrepancy
hence use the command this sets the required parameters and opens directly in hduser s home
depends on your ram size set the config like this in yarn site xml this is the total cluster memory in mapreduce set variable mapred site xml
since you have made changes in yarn xml mapreduce processing happens using yarn not using the traditional mapreduce framework
that s probably be the reason why you don t see tasktracker and jobtracker listed after executing the jps command
even though this is a warning slf4j will pick one logging framework implementation and bind with it binding is determined by the jvm and is mostly considered a random function
so it looks like line has no t in it so line split t 1 results in a single value causing something like word count foo
if you use a format class you should also create a recordreader so it understands how to read the text
the sequencefileinputformat then receives the individual files instead of the directories and thus the mapfile detection fails
since timestamp string is of type string you can just split on the
because external tables are not managed by hive
because you have build the hadoop plugin or you can use the existing plugin in your eclipse to run mapreduce
if anyone has factual info on why these contributed to it working it would be appreciated
this exception is raised because mongokey doesn t implement java io serializable
which is the best thing you can do or add only avro specific jars because exception thrown by avro class as per the screenshot
this is due to blank or space comes as a line you have to filter it
reason you might not have used location when creation your create table command
although doing the following did not remove the warning it for some reason fixed my speed issue
you should only need to do this once unless your namenode gets corrupted for some reason
it s because of the data skew
this property runs parallel query within same query like this one here the first select and second select statements are not dependent so they can be run parallely
hadoop jar word jar input output presently jar doesn t have entry point so it gives error if you don t specify the fully qualified name of class in the jar file
since the n increases for each line no matter which mapper is reading which line it gets the correct value of n i m then using the value of n to create a new key for each line document as in word doc n 1 where n is the value of each line number
i think it s the version problems because spark 1 1 x had import a new class named sparkuitab and it extends from webuitab but in spark 1 0 2 only use webuitab so if your spark core 2 10 s version is 1 0 2 but your spark streaming kafka 2 10 s version is 1 1 0 it will cause the version match problems
as per your job configurationthe signature should be explanation for your exception since you didn t override reducer s reduce the reducer will reduce with the default implementation which is called identity reducer source code as specified in the source code it simply iterate over values and write it using output key value calsses but in your case intermmediate pairs i e intwritable text do not match with pairs of dboutputformat
if i m interpreting your scenario correctly it isn t that a single mapper is bankrupting your memory it s possible that many more mappers are being spawned in parallel since there are so many more blocks of input this is where much of hadoop s parallelism comes from
using resourcemanager s ui if you are running yarn in the cluster then there would be no jobtracker running in your cluster hence you could not access http localhost 50030 jobtracker jsp but rather there would be a resourcemanager running and you could access the resourcemanager s web page by visiting http resource manager host 8088 cluster replace resource manager host with your resourcemanager s ip address
according to some discussions on internet the reason is the version of hadoop 2 x and using yarn i am using hadoop 2 6 0
if may be due to dfs replication set value 1 if not solve then check all the given properties should be in your files or not
this error was due to incorrect apache maven path and pom file i simply put pom xml file including mahout master full source code under apache maven 3 2 1 and run command again this method definitely solve this problem
also i think this problem my cased because i didn t add slaves lists in the file but i haven t test this
if yarn is not running the result may like if yarn is running the result may like there are two solutions 1 rename mapred site xml file execute linux command mv mapred site xml mapred site xml template or delete mapred site xml file then restart hadoop
the problem was because of different environmental settings for the root and my user accounts
adjusting that based on root account setting solved the problem
i solved the problem to make sure the same key is always distributed to the same reducer hashcode for the key must be implemented based on the current values in the key
a small explanation of the terminal command above since its a streaming job so we first put the location of streaming jar file of hadoop then the location of the input file followed by the location of output file try to give a unique name and should be present in hdfs then we tell hadoop what function we want to perform and where it will be performed map and reduce tasks followed by the file attribute to tell the location of scripts
i have used hadoop 0 20 2 because of certain limitations
but what you are trying to do is called secondary sort sorting based on value
it said is very sure your network packet is larger than the zk s default value so you should set java opts djute maxbuffer 10000000 djava awt headless true djava net preferipv4stack true to zk jvm and your client application
because you have set the number of reducer task as 0
oozie log dir is a server configuration so you will not be able to override that with the client for each job execution
having this in mind and the fact you don t have access to this node the most probable reason for your failure is because the cloudera manager cannot stops the services on it
the likely cause of seeing nulls is a mismatch between the datatypes in the on disk files and the ddl of the external table
in that case select still appears to work but it is a mirage
i suggest you to use new api this example is based on new api private static final string output path intermediate output is defined for 1st jobs output and it will be the input to second job
because it seems like your hbase is not working hopefully the problem will be with zookeeper
remove all register statement and use hbase hi instead of hbase hi because you are using hbase 0 98 8 and you are importing hbase 0 94 1 jar
there are number of ways you can do that and it mainly depends on how will your data be arriving to your cluster and how you will be processing it later
check out on how to make cross join efficiently since that s what you re doing
what to use will ultimately depend on your use case and your available environment
depending on what you need to do with those lists you may find that it s easier to simply pass in the result of collect list to your udf since they will already be lists
as soon as the data is copied in hdfs filesystem replicates the data based on the set replication ratio irrespective of process used to copy the data
i was able to fix it by removing codehause org repository from base pom xml entirely since all codehaus services have now been terminated
thats the reason terasort is used for most of the benchmarking jobs because it has all there teragen terasort teravalidate for itself
because it uses local file system and a single jvm there is no hadoop daemons in this mode
in psuedo distributed mode where all the daemons runs on the same machine the property d mapred reduce tasks n will work and results n reducers
found my solution i wasn t parsing new lines out of my sql dump and it caused issues with hive
or you could show the max min avg etc also because of the inner join there s a chance that not all rows will be returned but only rows where there s a matching id in both tables
probably want to stop the cluster first so it will pickup the changes
once you set up the cluster to start all daemons from master in order to start all nodes from master so commands would be
but for perfectionists you may also want to fix the callers of sbin hadoop daemons sh so that the commands are correct when you dump them
in my case all the occurrences are hdfs and since the slave side will rewrite the command path when it is hdfs related the command works just fine with or without this fix
here is the result when sbin start dfs sh is executed as you can see from the above result the script does not respect the slave side bashrc and etc hadoop hadoop env sh
solution from the result above we know that the variable hadoop conf dir is resolved at master side
however since the shell created by ssh with a command attached is a non interactive shell the bashrc script is not loaded on the slave side
therefore the following command prints nothing we can force it to load bashrc however the following block in bashrc default in ubuntu 18 04 guards non interactive shells at this point you may remove the above block from bashrc to try to achieve the goal but i don t think it s a good idea
i did not try it but i think that the guard is there for a reason
therefore i have a habit of keeping all profile bashrc bash logout unchanged and put any customizations into bash aliases
we could therefore load bash aliases instead of bashrc
so the following code does the job and the hadoop home from the slave side is printed by applying this technique to the sbin hadoop daemons sh script the result is the short answer mentioned above
an output file cannot be written by several processes mappers or reducers therefore in order to generate several output files i either have to define custom partitioning or group the data in the reducer and have the key in the output file name
impala can natively work with hive tables so the sings are really simple
but i d recommend you also to take a look at the mpp databases because using sas means you have pretty structured data and mpp database would be a better fit for this case
since you re using cloudera you should take a look at cloudera manager which automates the installation and management of hadoop clusters and should play nice with vms as well as long as you have some serious ram http www cloudera com content cloudera en documentation cloudera manager v4 8 2 cloudera manager introduction cmi primer html this is the installation guide http www cloudera com content cloudera en documentation cloudera manager v4 8 2 cloudera manager installation guide cloudera manager installation guide html
in the brute force approach you calculate distances between each of n pois and each of m checkins leading to time complexity of o n m
and share the results
i had some user permissions issue in accessing the table and also had to add the following property config to do the trick
since it is running locally but not on the cluster my wild guess would be a missing sparkcontext definition
it solved the problem but i am not aware of the root cause
in the fist look you can make sure about these to make sure that you ve set the mahout path correctly use this command this should not return an empty string when you run mahout locally also hadoop conf dir should be set to hadoop home conf here s a list of popular environment variables for hadoop also you get a heap error and you should increase your heap size so jvm will be enable to initialize also you may help to solve your error by adding more info about your cluster how many machine are you using
that is because it launch namenode and datanode through hadoop daemons sh but it failed
go through these joins documentation once and apply based on your file sizes and requirement
i managed to extract the values with a different approach because i just wanted some of the fields of the line
common cause of such errors is this your software was compiled against 1 7 6 version of avro but in runtime classes from older version were probably loaded
also you have another error in your pom that may very well cause you problems maybe the very ones you re seeing
you are using avro mapred artifact compiled for hadoop2 while the hadoop artifact you re depending on is that of hadoop1
which causes that new shared lib feature doesn t work as the endpoint is not registered
your answers are as follows what is the reason of the file under tf vectors folder to be that small
what is the reason of the file under tf vectors folder to be that small
i was using hortonworks sandbox v2 2 after long time of debugging i found out there s some conflicts between spark version i installed manually v1 2 and hortonworks sandbox libraries so i decided to use cloudera quickstart 5 3 0 and now everything working fine
from what i can see of the source code i assume you re using this serde the put method of the jsonobject object class could be overridden so that all instances of whitespace in the key parameter are converted prior to insertion into the underlying map object
if you are willing to entertain the approach using the staging table you could always load up your raw text and use get json object to extract what you need since spaces are perfectly fine in json paths for hive
since all this is behind our firewalls bandwidth has never been an issue so we don t worry about size of our jars
as easy as instead of is thanks to a good example
also since you mentioned it being a single node cluster you can use localhost or private ip
i haven t used an elastic ip because i might have more than one of these running and a time and for now at least i don t mind looking up the public ip address
the specific step i took was insanely simple after all thanks to occam s razor
some of my inputs have the first couple lines are comments and therefore the portions array failed due to index out of bound
i tried a lot searching above error didnt get right one but found the cause for error caused by java lang unsatisfiedlinkerror usr lib java jre lib i386 xawt libmawt so libxi so 6 cannot open shared object file no such file or directory that was due to ubuntu 64 bit with 32 bit jdk 7 then i re install ubuntu 32 bit and followed the steps on the link it works for me
try shrinking your input split size so that more tasks will be created
thanks to legato for giving me an idea to investigate this by doing od c and seeing actual characters between the string
i found various issues in the hbase jira which described similar issues
this is mainly because hadoop is confused while serializing the data
for the record this is an excerpt from the linked documentation linking applications to the hadoop version in addition to compiling spark itself against the right version you need to add a maven dependency on that version of hadoop client to any spark applications you run so they can also talk to the hdfs version on the cluster
also note that those characters might not be visible in all editors depends on the encoding
because it is a validation error it has not come in logs yet so the only way is check the exception details cli response aws console my guess is that instance types you used are not supported in emr they are supported in ec2 but not in emr
do you have write permissions for so you can create out1
these shouldn t cause this error however
to answer my own question the issue was leading whitespaces which caused the matcher to fail
the unit test didn t test with leading whitespaces but the actual logs had those for some reason
as anony mousse had mentioned this is expensive because hadoop datatypes are designed to be reused
it also caused a bigger problem with serialization and deserialization
when hadoop tried to reconstruct the class by calling readfields it caused a npe because all the fields were null
as you can further read in that same book i have a copy by my side there is a huge concern regarding bandwidth
therefore the closest the data node is to the mapper task the better performance will be delivered
you can also read in that same book that hadoop does not guess the network topology by itself there is a chapter for such configuration regarding question 2 ideally the size of the split should be the same as the size of the hdfs block
sometimes the files cannot be splited if you check the compression you will see certain compression algorithms do not allow split therefore the mapper will have to fetch several blocks
if you some how manage to achieve your said partition with or this will lead to data loss for score field as you will not be able to get back the actual score value for each record
the suggested approach will be to keep score as is and create a new column specifically for partition which has a value of new or old based on requirement and derive this column value based on score column
you will have to run the insert into query a couple of times based on the condition that you require
after looking into yarn application logs i saw the true cause in diagnostics section which was reduce capability required is more than the supported max container capability in the cluster
it was because of iterator
such issues come due to couple reasons like below not overriding the reduce method it s better to annotate with override as mentioned in an earlier comment forgetting to set reducer in the driver code
in that case this should work an outer join where there is no match edit enclosed on clause in this is not normally required of any major databases but seems to be needed in hiveql https cwiki apache org confluence display hive languagemanual joins
regarding your first query i don t think it wouldn t work in hive based on example queries in those docs however as another commenter mentioned it is best practice to use explicit joins via the join clause rather than implicit joins in the where clause
think of the where clause as where you filter based on various conditions except for join conditions and the join clause as where you put all join conditions
based on your description it seems that namenode ha high availability is the setup you are after see more details at hadoop doc hdfs high availability using the quorum journal manager
so to get the result the following code will do
don t know why but for some reason maven did not like these
the error is caused as the hadoop streaming environment variable is not set right in your code
in my case a glitch in my setup was causing yarn to fail to list any nodes and so giraph thought that 0mb of heap was available to the cluster
the problem was that i was using it within lenskit and the configuration class tries to use thread currentthread getcontextclassloader which for whatever reason doesn t have the mahout or hadoop packages
i think there was some exception during start which was not shown because it s executed in a thread pool
managed to find the cause
so since the ports are fine connection reset by peer happens when the request made by the reduce task is not fulfilled or the result is truncated it might also happen if it could not find the appropriate file can also happen because of permissions
the problem was i was doing ssh through root to my slaves the communication between the job tracker and task tracker is too frequent hence the issue connection refused by peer
since i m using hadoop 2 6 0 i ve changed mapred site xml according to the release see below my mapred site xml file property name mapreduce framework name name value yarn value property property name mapreduce jobtracker address name value hadoopmaster 54311 value description the host and port that the mapreduce job tracker runs at
your problem is caused probably by trying to serialise bytebuffers
let s say the python reducer script depends on package d1 which in turn depends on d2 thus resolving op s query on transitive dependencies and both d1 and d2 are not installed on any machine in the cluster
that was because the yarn file was missing this property i have also triple checked that all the config files are the same on all the nodes
you are getting the exception because java is trying to convert null string to integer
this depends on the dependencies used in the program
at the moment ambari does not support centos 7 so that s not going to work
based on the cloud provider you have the open the ports of your virtual machines
one possible reason is that your file is not uploaded on the hdfs
go untill the end of that file and you will probably see the exact error causing the problem best of luck
i think there is no issue in the syntax
found solution to my own question after hell lot of google research first i thought the error was due to missing jar files but it was simple permission issue
after following this great post in web http www hadoopinrealworld com fixing org apache hadoop security accesscontrolexception permission denied after digging in hadoop error log files main error was org apache hadoop security accesscontrolexception permission denied user anonymous access execute inode staging ubuntu supergroup rwxr xr x so i simply given writes to the staging directory in which the intermediate mapping was done hadoop fs chown anonymous anonymous tmp hadoop yarn staging and that solved my problem now i can run my hive aggregation and joins commands through spagobi interface which is connected to hive database through jdbc connection
nevertheless i think you can create never tested just figuring out how to do such a thing custom sources and sinks that work both as sources and sinks in that case you could have 2 channels one for each direction and perform some kind of back communication
i mean you do not want to implement that kind of synchronous communications because the new data arriving to the flume agent will have to wait a lot
in the end it was my own filesplit subclass causing the problem
hadoop calls getfsstatistics on the null path causing the nullpointerexception
but if you know about hadoop counters you can create your own custom counters based on your requirements and pragmatically write the output to the file you have created
this approach will not give 100 exact result but it will be very close to the original execution time
myshell sh to cross verify the shell script result i just took the below pig script and executed in both 0 14 and also in the above shell script
while copying each file is copied as group of independent block if all the block of file is copied then only the client is notified otherwise the process fails say you are copying abc txt which is of 100mb so it is copied in term of block default 64 mb for every block the client connects namenode and obtain the adrress of datanode for actually storing the block so suppose 1 block is getting copied and namenode goes down then at the 2nd block when client again connects to datanode for obatining address it will get an error failed on connection exception java net connectexception connection refused
hdfs component uses chunk to consume so if noop is true camel will think that it already consumed it
it depends on what you are trying to do
change this property from to you were having the problem because the final execution path became hive home hive home lib hive hwi version war this happened because you are already at the hive home directory while reading the configuration file
the error you re getting looks like it is because your file path is incorrect
also take a look at https github com b cube nutch crawler it s a fork of nutch 1 9 with the crawl class so you can run it as a hadoop job
the second message occurs because hadoop fs will look on hdfs not on your local filesystem
ok it s because i was using port 81
i think the problem is your are using 2 sinks reading both of them from a single channel in that case a flume event read by one of the 2 sinks is not read by the other one and viceversa
otherwise if you do have null values you can use grouping __ id note grouping __ id depends on the order of the expressions in the group by so rearranging the group by can change the meanings of the flag
it is because your input value to your mapper is empty
try to add property one thing while running the launchcontainer cmd located in hadoop tmp appcache location it arise an issue in accessing the dll for running mapreduce on windows platform ie msvcr100 dll is missing to handle the tez job as bellow provide full privilege to hadoop tmp directory and try to replaced moved msvcr100 dll c windows system32 file in windows machine to run the mapreduce program for tez job
the log output snipped you showed is somewhat deceiving because when the flag isn t set impala actually sets that value manually and it shows up as if it were passed by the user
anyway you should check that the hostname is properly changed on the box which may depend on your os
this may happen due to idle timeout on ignite job tracker default port 11211
there are a couple of possible issues here regarding local file system instead of hdfs yarnconfiguration should load core site xml your core site xml should have something like in addition this core site xml should be in the classpath of your application please note that hadoop jars also have a default empty core site xml so you have to make sure yours has precedence
this is the reason why yarnconfiguration will not load mapreduce xml but these files will be loaded by mapreduce code when you try to submit a mapreduce job
prefix filter is usually a performance killer because they perform full table scan always use a start and stop row in your scans rather than prefix filter
when iterate over the result from the resultscanner every iteration is an rpc call you can call resultscanner next n to get a batch of results in one go
so change your java home variable so that it points to jdk 6 kit rather than jdk7
they have everything pre installed so you can concentrate on your mapreduce or hive instead of just installing
this is the reason for the error
i believe that the size of input file that the job takes should be to the input split size this could be the reason you are seeing one mapper prepared for the job
if the query is currently returning all of the correct output except for that column and that column should have the same value on all rows of the result set and it can be returned by running a query that just counts all distinct users from the million song table you can add a cross join with the query that grabs that total count
but if you try to run some job you wil get into trouble because the slave will try to connect the resource manager using the address which means if you are not able to resolve the ubuntu hostname use the ip
the ubuntu hostname gets resolved to 192 168 1 232 because you just defined this in your etc hosts file
because the map task that are scheduled on the slaves tries a long time to connect to resource manager and eventually fails
only those map tasks which are scheduled on the master node as you are using your master also as a slave will succeed because the ubuntu correctly resolved the resource manager ip on the master node only
this error mostly occurs due to loopback problems
try to remove these lines from etc hosts and disable you ipv6 if you are not using it one problem with ipv6 is that using 0 0 0 0 for the various networking related hadoop configuration options will result in hadoop binding to the ipv6 addresses
so if you are not using ipv6 it s better to disable it because it can cause problems while running hadoop
you need to use iterable as you are using new map reduce api s because reduce object iterable org apache hadoop mapreduce reducer context method is called for each in the sorted inputs
you should use hadoop serialization so that any inputformat of your mapreduce job would read input records
this type of error usually comes when there is a version conflict so please make sure your sqoop version is compatible with your hadoop distribution
this is because of latest compiled class and dependent jar available in the application are of different version
for example let class a compiled with dependent jar x in place then later same class a compiled in different environment withe dependent jar x1 which consist new method called y in that
now the class will be compiled because new method y is available in jar x1 when the same class a is used in the environment with jar x in place then it leads to the nosuchmethod exception when trying to load the class in the class memory
thanks to you guys for helping
in order to test this you should create a shell script that will dump the environment into a log file so you can inspect it and determine what s different chmod x this script and execute this instead of your hadoop command
in that case copy all the libraries from the hbase and add into the hadoop refer the hadoop env sh hadoop dir contrib capacity scheduler it worked for me
post the results for following commands in your question
you can precise your analyzer with the seq2sparse command the analyzer is an apache lucene analyzer so you ll have to precise the name as followed per example i suggest that you read the official documentation for more information about what you can do with the seqsparse command
if you need to include avro tools for some reason you ll have to download a version that s been compiled against your version of hadoop cloudera has this in their repository but i m uncertain where to get it for emr or compile avro tools yourself
note replace the path to yours the result on the picture
just add the override annotation before your map and reduce methods so that they will show the errors
otherwise you dont see any errors but since the signature doesnt match the default identitymapper is being called and hence the error
this parameter needs to be set carefully and if not set properly this could lead to bad performance or outofmemory errors
you d get much better results
you could be getting this error because have not updated your bashrc variables
i recommend you to do it in this way pd i don t know anything of hadoopy i m just talking from my experience with hadoop and some items should be equally handled in both so that s the reason why i m answering here please correct my if i m wrong
the error network adaptor could not establish connection is coming because of incorrect jdbc url
this is because either jar files not available deleted or the jar location not set in the classpath
number of container are dependent on the number of blocksize
out of memory errors occur because of several reasons
it is not possible to provide a input size which will not result in out of memory errors
please verify you have enough space in the directory based on your input file size
so i added a new disk in that node change hdfs site xml dfs data dir accordingly
modern versions of hadoop 2 4 enable yarn mapreduce2 by default so the older mrv1 jobtracker tasktracker commands won t work out of the box
this is because the hadoop common jar has to be included for the org apache commons configuration configuration class
the input data to map reduce will be split based on the size of your input data
once all the mappers are completed the reducers will be triggered based on the output keys from the mapper
the error unable to initialize any output collector indicates that the job failed to start the container s there can be multiple reasons for the same
however one must review the container logs at hdfs to identify the cause the error
in this specific instance the value of mapreduce task io sort mb value was entered greater than 2047 mb however the maximum value which it allows is 2047 mb thus anything above its causes the jobs to fail marking the value provided as invalid
this may be due to pig fails in the operation due to high default parallel could be set in it
since you are using the single node cluster you can try cleaning up your log directories var log and bring the name node out of safe mode and delete the hdfs directory left by sqoop
most probable cause is your heartbeat setting for zookeeper aka ticktime is higher and minimum session timeout can t be lower than 2 ticktime
in my case it was eof exception which was because of a client library and server mismatch
because if so this won t work json and protobuf are different formats
the startup script will tell the classpath to look here for the connector jar for some reason
on your last workflow you didn t close the host tag should be for the shell error first i recommend to use the version 0 2 defined here https oozie apache org docs 4 0 0 dg shellactionextension html ae a appendix a shell xml schema and to remove all the parameters and everything not useful to start the action do not care about the results
any url that does not match the patterns you defined will not be stored in the db therefore will not be used in the next cycle
this error come from the pig binary your variable pig home is therefore undefined and for some reason could not been set automatically
take this only as a guess because i have no idea how you initialized the post variable
therefore i suggest you change the way you store your data to the following format
this caused the issue and it has been fixed by changing the compression codec to default
you are importing the first python udf as m1 therefore you should access its namespace with m1 foo and not from module one
based on what i ve found here how do i get the path and name of the file that is currently executing i managed to register the path that contains the custom module i want to load in my pig udf by doing so if your module two is running from the same folder as module one that it includes this should make it work for pig
after digging i found that the problem was due to nodemanager not in a good health i ve seen local dirs turned bad in the health report
i solved the problem by changing my reduce function so that if there were not the correct amount of fields to output a certain value and then i was able to use the input null non string with that value and it worked
reason cause of this type of error is you run oozie server as a hadoop user but you define oozie as a proxy user in core site xml file
i have created following dummy table deli i used following query and its giving me following result for your data
for example for your case if you want to remove duplicate records based on a specific key column for example based on se no column set the key value as sortbyvars se no
it depends on your requirement
you can use map reduce for giving it a series of inputs will produce the output which is given to reducer based on key and list of values
so in your case based on what you said and the reasonable amount of data it does not make sense to pay the cost of using hadoop
i see several solutions hive hbase integration supports composite primary keys concat ws columns reflect java util uuid randomuuid sha1 concat ws columns could result in collisions see https cwiki apache org confluence display hive hbaseintegration hbaseintegration simplecompositerowkeys
hence each mapper will consume certain amount of physical memory
teradata causes issues when duplicate data is exported to it repeatedly
i also had a issue with teradata cause i tried to export same table multiple times and it started throwing errors
once you do this export the java home variable so that other processes which are looking for java home can use this path
it was happening due to clock out of sync it was solved when i ran the below command
it ll look something like this note that you really want to avoid opening a 0 0 0 0 0 source range since hadoop isn t doing authentication or authorization on those incoming requests
you may need to open up a couple other ports as well depending on what functionality you use connecting to hadoop
the more general recommendation is that wherever possible you should try to run your code on the hadoop cluster itself in that case you ll use the master hostname itself as the hdfs authority rather than external ip that way you can limit the port exposure to just the ssh port 22 where incoming traffic is properly gated by the ssh daemon and then your code doesn t have to worry about what ports are open or even about dealing with ip addresses at all
not that it matters to anyone since the question has so low views still i m posting the solution that worked for me finally
what i didnt know is that while registryoperationsfactory initialize it it still need to get started so this code works
hence the exception
rajest is right hdfs command does not need sudo probably you are using sudo su hdfs because command is attacking to path where only user hdfs has permissions you must organize data for your users
so it seems the error was due to mismatch of hadoop libraries in the lib directory of hbase which was hadoop 2 5 1 against my actual hadoop installation hadoop 2 6 0
my jar was looking for classes which it was not finding in the older version of the hadoop libraries due to which it was failing
try editing bashrc file while logged in as the sudo user so it works either way
i got the result
errors in output shown above are due to hadoop jars not being in classpath
the issue turned out to be that i had a column name called text and that was causing the error
if everything is correct in the main method you wrote something like that to tell hadoop the directory where to find your two input files and where to write the results of the computation
at the end of the computation when the reducer emits its data hadoop is going to write the results in one or more files in the specified output directory
generally speaking the data locality can reduce the run time because it can save the time that block transmission by network
recently i optimize hadoop and hdfs we use ssd to instead the hdd disk but we found the effect is not good and time is not shorter because the disk is not the bottleneck and network load is not heavy
according to the result we conclude the cpu is very heavy
since you didnt specify full path while doing copyfromlocal and mkdir
the problem is because of the version mismatch in the libraries that you used in the code
i found the solution i used hadoop core dependency in the pom xml file and hadoop core was a part of hadoop 1 x package and the rest of the dependency was from hadoop 2 x hence there was a version conflict
and now i know the reason is that the vm s ip has changed
thats the reason you were able to run once path is set
you may have an outdated driver in your classpath that s causing the conflict in read preference settings
this caused the txn manager to be set initialized and couldnt be reset until a new session was opened
just set the number of reduces to 0 so the no
and once reducer task is set to zero the result will be unsorted
the problem was due to protobuf version mismatch
so in order to talk with each other they need to use the common protobuf version because the message format is different for different protobuf version
write a simple utility which connects to both databases simultaneously fetches data from two tables to compare and compares the result set
if you re set on using terminal then this ll do it at this point you can try to run however atheros and ubuntu seem to have a strange sort of not working thing going on and so that command doesn t work with my wireless driver
i figured out the reason i was getting the error
i have found this problem is caused by missing the jar file of protobuf java 2 4 1 jar in this dictionary opt cloudera parcels spark lib spark lib
update protobuf to 2 5 from 2 4 x in 2 1 0 beta https issues apache org jira browse hadoop 9845 reason protobuf 2 5 0 bug
result need delete exclusion protobuf v2 5 0 in spark core
the reverse dns isn t working maybe because your router isn t doing it s job
i m running on my laptop so only need one entry you d need to set this for each machine in your cluster but make sure to add in don t replace your etc hosts
go to another location and this may cause the router reverse dns to fail because etc hosts takes precedence over any other lookup
i set my home router to give a reserved address to my laptop to match my other location so it works between the two
you cannot do exactly what you want in hive because a sql query has to have a fixed number of columns when it is defined
note verify the java path after setting by the command echo java home previous post this could not be the issue with hadoop since the hadoop process is not able to execute the java itself
fyi its not recommendable to have the jdk directory in the root folder since hadoop or java can be run by any of the users on the machine
fyi its not recommendable to have the jdk directory in the root folder since hadoop or java can be run by any of the users on the machine so you can move the jdk directory to usr lib or opt directories
for the first part of the question it might be due to incorrect url of namenode or jobtracker for the second part you have to configure the core site xml the property fs defaultfs to hdfs host port also in your java program set path of core site xml in your config object
possible reason the memory allocated for the tasks trackers sum of mapred
your sqoop arguments contain a dynamic parameter that is expressed as a bash script snippet using date so it works when you run it in a linux console
the reason is that hadoop does not support servlet api 3 0 https issues apache org jira browse hadoop 9244
since there can be more than one mapper it is not possible to determine which key from right side will not have matching key on left side because single mapper will not see whole left side data
in high availability mode you should not start secondary checpoint node as that will result in error in case of activenode fails
since standby namenode is doing all their duties already
you do not have the data partitioned because you have not created it
this is because the user directory not found
as you can see this is a write permissions problem because myuser does not have permissions to write in hive warehouse
but i found the root cause so that you can solve the problem yourself
as checked your logs the problem is because of windows sdk v7 1 with net framework 4 5 exception actual exception is fatal error lnk1123 failure during conversion to coff file invalid or corrupt you can google it to find the solution
i found i was able to clear up the outofmemory gc overhead exception by adding a partition column to the where clause of the query so i ve concluded that having a very large number of splits is causing this exception
this can be done as this is because hadoop takes its io serializations from hadoop conf not from spark conf
therefore setting this io serializations in sparkconf is of no use
then it s not useful to compute the exact count so the query could be refined as edit there is no bit datatype in hive
since you are mentioning only one disk 1 x 256 in your command it is not able to meet it s requirements
okay i fixed it for some reason i re read that error message and saw that there was no datanodes running again
with millions of files this can be gigabytes of data which was too much and caused the master node to crash
hdfs rollinterval is described as so this line should cause the files to allocate for an hour at a time and i would additionally ignore file size and event count so add these as well
it is a classpath problem root cause is java lang classnotfoundexception class com cloudera hive serde jsonserde you can have a look here to add hive serdes https github com cloudera cdh twitter example
the problem was with the master url so i removed setting the master url
in my case the issue occurs not because of some environment variable but because of antlr being included on the classpath of an application that s using spark including hive and its dependencies
the namenode provides these details based on availability of datanodes and network distance from client to datanodes
it varies or depends on logic
the reason is that you did not specified the done flag so oozie uses the default success you should add an empty to the dataset
sqoop incremental imports for free form queries was added from sqoop 1 4 2 jira link sqoop incremental import support for free form queries since you are using sqoop 1 2 0 this feature might not be available for you to use
that could be by a network issue or because the data nodes are too busy to respond or they are down
the exception is not enough to track the root cause
according to the change log public list string com google common base splitter splittolist charsequence has been introduced since version 15 0
according to the change log public list string com google common base splitter splittolist charsequence has been introduced since version 15 0 so you may have to change the version from 14 0 to 15 0 or later
i would guess the output of the job was trying to write to s3 and therefore make the output directory
because i think at run time hadoop will look for jar files in the folder in which hadoop is installed
one thing to take into consideration is that sqllline command has to be executed with an ip that is in the zookeeper quorum and this is something we were doing wrong since we were trying to run it from the namenode and it wasn t in the zookeeper quorum once we run sqlline py from a datanode everything is working fine
anyway even if the deployment would work you wouldn t be able to complete the tutorial since romeo wrote it the analytics for hadoop service has been upgraded
part of the tutorial is no longer correct and last i checked there was a problem with the hdfs node in node red on bluemix in that it could no longer connect to hadoop
satish for the issue you are seeing it seems that the adding removing of services may have caused an issue
the hdfsresource has close hdfs properly which causes oozie workflow fail to get hdfs due to connection closed
thanks to samson scharfrichter i was able to debug this issue
just store the result of this query in another table test with single column app id
after it writes some x bytes due to some network issue the datanode fails the pipeline is first closed and any data written to that is deleted the new good datanode is given a new identity and is added to the queue and the same is communicated to name node to update the metadata information for block 4 and then the data would be written to that newly identified datanode starting from the 1st byte of that block
spark treats the continuation of last column on next line as new line and hence the load is getting failed
zookeeper comes in between hmaster and region servers so the issue seems to be the link between hmaster and zookeeper
not sure how you have installed and configured hbase so you can use any link here link1 link2 link3 link4
as the fsck report shows you have 68 files in hdfs and hence 68 blocks
it won t fail when adding it into the record it will fail when it tries to serialize because it is at that point when it is trying to match the type
its is because of the mapreduce job reduce slowstart completedmaps property which s default value is 0 05
the progress calculation also takes in account the processing of data transfer which is done by reduce process therefore the reduce progress starts showing up as soon as any intermediate key value pair for a mapper is available to be transferred to reducer
as a result your program couldn t find classes of hdfs file system
hadoop requires a jdk so you need a jdk 6 installed
as mapreduce works on the data which is in hdfs so you could try these things
2 regarding parallelization while storing the data in hdfs the framework will split the file and save it based on the blocksize specified 64 mb by default
e g some word to any number to just keep count and then reduce it based on key
here you are aware that you have only four files so you can hard code four variable
the hive logs can be found in the user folder of main azure storage account for your hdinsight cluster
anyway cloudera give a solution based on a script to execute as a gateway between cloudera manager navigator and the ldap active directory http www cloudera com content cloudera en documentation core latest topics cm sg external auth html cmug topic 13 9 3 unique 1
as explained on apache hive wiki page hive exec scratchdir hive metastore warehouse dir the above explanations essentially mean that changing your scratch directory location won t help you with the database location since this is just a temporary location used by hive to store mapreduce job progress plans and any other intermediate data
you can also make your scratch directory point to the same location as your database but it doesn t make sense using the same location for scratch and database unless you have a specific use case that requires it this way as hive would create a lot of directories based on users executing the queries
hence changing hive warehouse path property in hive configurations will not make any impact
that should tell you what the class was compiled under therefore the minimum runtime you ll need to execute
non managed tables to prevent accidental data loss due to ddl statements
this dependency of org apache hadoop hadoop yarn client 1 0 4 for you doesn t seem like it is because of build sbt
perhaps there is something wrong with your cached files in ivy2 or m2 or maybe because of some project sbt files introducing additional dependencies
else after group by flatten the result and then filter
if nothing is there see if you can change the logging level to warn or info because flume isn t supposed to crash
other usage is when performing joins which include a big and small data set so that rather than using multiple input paths we use a single input big file and get the other small file using distributed cache and then compare or join both the data sets
the reason for more time in your case is because you are trying to read entire 2 gb file before the map reduce starts as it is started in setup method
can you give the reason why you are loading the the huge 2gb file using distributed cache
you almost had the answer if is fetching the result then try out individual fields here it says a cast exception to double so you can take only the double fields
you are trying to pass a update statement in a executequery for security reasons any update statement will fail when using this method
change it to executeupdate also instead of using queries like this i suggest using prepared statements since by using parameters you make it less vulnerable to sql injections
the error is very likely not originated from within the odbc driver but in the server
if this issue is also reproducible with beeline then the error might be originated from the thrift server while fetching the results
in that case you may want to check the server logs for more details about the error
you can do this in thus way put all path there and after run
if you have code that mostly works except for some files here is what you probably want to do when thinking harder doesn t solve the problem find a file in which the error occurs and keep this data try the top half of the data if the error occurs keep that part and go to 1 try the bottom part just to be sure if the error occurs go to 1 within a few steps you should have only 1 line left that is causing the error and which should be simple to inspect
if you plan to grab the 12 value in the input string i assume that from the regex you have you d better use a negated character class that matches any character even a newline thus no need in s other than a
note that a capturing group based solution is best here however it depends on what is easier for you to implement in hadoop
if you still need to know if it is the end of the string or not keep the capturing group at the end i wrap the dot into a character class so that it was treated as a literal period not any character but a newline subpattern
somehow above mentioned error got resolved and i was then stuck in to an different error like below it was obvious that error is due to some compatibility issues
if you change the config in the archive it does not take an effect
the shell scripts under opt samza bin remains the same every build thus you don t need to untar the archive package because of the shell scripts
please access your hadoop 50070 port and check your input path if it not exist then execute wordcount will be cause a exception
you are not specifying this property hdfs filetype so it is taking this as a default sequencefile try adding this line to your hdfs sink and let me know if this works
in that case you cannot find the deb hue packages
jps output is inconsistent depending on multiple factors that can usually be fixed but i stopped trying
but yes there are 2 solutions get a new computer that supports virtualization with at least 8 gb ram because that s what you need to run the vm or install cloudera manager on a bare metal server
example input and the result of the dump this is what you d like to do
you can try to run hadoop fsck the exact command may vary depending on version to perform a health check of hdfs
if this happens to you it is probably because you are reusing jobs from someone else
that s because it s expecting the package to appear before any additional arguments such as file
if you told me it s unclear for some reason i d try to do better but cutting and pasting rd docs is against the rules
after a large amount of serach i come across some results that i am storing my data in default format of hadoop i e
also manjunath is correct as we reduce the replication factor it might reduce the storage space but it will cause some problems as well
this is because of a compatibility problem between pig 15 and hbase 112 https issues apache org jira browse pig 4728 download the pig 15 source and use the following command to compile it ant clean dhadoopversion 23 dhbase95 version 1 1 1 jar this will work
the problem is because of that
how to improve performance depends on how your data is shaped and what analysis you need to perform on it
do these instructions and tell me the result
the issues had nothing to do with the hana spark connector in particular any other files would have caused the same issue sooner or later
but you re trying to copy to hdfs localhost 9000 user hive warehouse imdb db vts so you should check that directory s permissions
because in the text you talk about s3 wordcountbuckett wc jar but in your add step configuration you specify s3 mywordcountbuckett
try make input format format csv sep col names names mtcars because of the way partitioned files are read headers in csv are not supported which means you have to remove them if present
for a reason i really do not understand i found a way to convert a csv to native format
so working with the mtcars dataset and separating it in to two csv files one for the names mtcars names csv and one for the data mtcars no names csv result as stated the column names dissapear but now if i apply the bind cols function for a reason i don t understand the output is in native format result so it seems that the csv format is converted to native whenever a plyrmr function other then input and output is applied
your problem with the partitioning is due to the number of reducers
thus setting mapred reduce tasks to 2 will solve this issue
since i was using longwritable as a null value instead of null writable space is added in the last of each line and due to this us was listed as us and partition was not able to divide the orders
go to the bin flume ng file and add a set x at the top so you will see the debug output for the bash file
this happens because the d configuration passing doesn t work with hadoop as with a normal jvm configuration
it can cause issues such as out of memory to the namenode as metadata of the files will be stored in memory
in hdp yarn log aggregation file formats s default value is indexedformat tfile so it will aggregate the logs in indexed file format only in app logs user logs ifile remove the indexedfile value for the yarn log aggregation file formats property
edit 1 here is the code you have many issues in the code
your log appears to be incomplete but currently the cause that is closest to being the root cause is a problem with class conversion
partition column name make sure this column is indexed somehow sqoop first queries the min and max values then issues a series of queries that return evenly distributed portions of all rows based on this column value
this is not valid query and hence it is failing with syntax errors
there is an open issue in jira for solrj httpclient version conflict
the root cause of this issue is httpclient library version conflict in hadoop class path
since you mentioned vagrant
this is probably because of a lack of configuration
ok i finally find the answer it is unbelievable through the hbase gc log i see a long full gc suggest my hbase s heap size is default 1 gb so it maybe occurred problem when i increase it to 4 gb heap i use lots of compression is normal so please remember the lession
based on your args cformat use the correct dash sign not
hadoop annotations depends on a jdk jar you have to exclude this in the p2 maven plugin configuration
to continue hadoop doesn t expect jars to be included within the jars since the path of hadoop is set globally
see udf documentation here https cwiki apache org confluence display hive languagemanual udf languagemanualudf complextypeconstructors but unfortunately if you do that you ll get because unfortunately hive does not support the use of udf functions in the values clause yet
the tomcat exception is due to the fact that in the common loader have not been loaded the yarn s library
simply add the path usr local hadoop share hadoop yarn jar in the common loader usr local sqoop server conf catalina properties the error of log4j instead i think it is an issue because it is present even if log4j jar is loaded just once in the common loader
i find a solution to my question actually the answer depends on the database if the database manages ha and failover there is no need to have loadbalancers otherwise we need it in case of failure
i tried out your program and got a correct result in my cluster
install this file slf4j log4j12 1 4 3 jar cause if u have received this error u need to install the above file below is the error for not been able to launch hive shell root nn 1 hive hive logging initialized using configuration in file etc hive conf dist hive log4j properties slf4j failed to load class org slf4j impl staticloggerbinder
the reason why it works when using chararray is that it interprets 1 2 3 as a string which on the other hand cannot be converted into an integer loading would then be done like this
should be since your expected results are grouping by item not store
if you installed default jdk by command then you should set java home as because this path is taken by default and you need to update at bashrc file too
since i fixed it here is how i did it
the problem is not the table name the problem is that you are using select from database 2016 my table but the database is named default so it should be select from default 2016 my table
because you should not specify any mapper classes when you use multipleinputs
sqoop does not support udf s so you might want to look at pig spark sparksql for this
flumeng hdfs sink depends on the following jar files which are not included in flume lib folder
i found it s actually caused by the mismatch of namenode s host not port
such a situation could by caused by update wrong namenode config when moving namenode
since i don t know nuthin about your teradata stack fondly nicknamed taratata by some of your french speaking colleagues i ll take the oracle stack as an example
inside a pl sql block you can retrieve the scalar result of a query into a variable and use it later as an input bind variable in a prepared statement or as a way to build dynamically a string to be parsed dynamically as a sql query
bottom line since hive has no procedural language and will probably hopefully never have one the best way to do what you want would be to develop your own custom hive client all by yourself with whatever business logic you want
after all there must be thousands of people around the world who are developing java code to access hive with jdbc so you would not be alone
note i used com bizo hive serde csv csvserde because the data was double quoated the hive table with csv csvserde
your producer is reachable to kafka node 1 which is leader for topic job aws 14 so you are able to produce messages to that topic while coming to topic job aws 8 leader is kafka node 2 and your producer might not be reachable to node 2
i am giving you answer accordingly
if you want to use new style casts you might need both a const cast to cast from const char to char and a reinterpret cast depending on how str ptr is defined
that s because you need a pointer to c string and you provide a pointer to std string
but since you pass it to a function this function should probably handle this
i would say that depending on hive transaction for now is not a good idea
i think it depends upon how much size are you allocating for containers
i don t know if this the cause of your problem but the 2 argument overload of addfiletoclasspath is deprecated in hadoop 1 2 1
the javadocs don t say why the method has been deprecated so it is hard to know if this could be the problem
and in your actual use case you don t have to check each key but only a batch id more precisely the original file name the way i ve done it in my previous job was that implies an extra column in your target table but since orc is a columnar format it s the number of distinct values that matter so that the overhead would stay low
note the explicit distinct in the sub query a mature dbms optimizer would automatically do it at execution time but hive does not not yet so you have to force it
note also the 1 is just a dummy value required because of select semantics again a mature dbms would allow a dummy null but some versions of hive would crash e g
with tez in v0 14 so 1 or a are safer
once i did this before running the etl i can send to hive an alter table drop if exists partition file name so that the folder containing the input data is deleted if this input file has already been sent to the orc table
in oozie on yarn model you can try setting sqoop client in each node which yarn scheduled cause of that yarn might send your sqoop workflow to the node which does not have sqoop client
tableau wraps your entire query in a sub query and hive doesn t support using with within a sub query that is the reason why this query was failing when written as custom sql within tableau
the reason it s now working is that your trying to use java
for this reason you can actually use any language even bash
i also got same issue when i try it in another browser it worked so you can try in different browser
it was happening because the couple of files did not have the required permission to write
the problem was in the main function i was not specify what is the output of the mapper so the reducer was expecting the default one as input
just solved it it was because of the expired link it was replaced with https archive apache org dist bigtop bigtop 0 7 0 repos centos6 bigtop repo
because your hadoop configuration uses deprecated properties
you can create database with partitions based on date
i have managed to recover though i still don t know what caused the issue
this is what was causing the npe in the original post
after i changed the 3 values in that field to 11 12 and 13 respectively i was able to log into the ui without issue
i don t know what occurred that would have caused that to happen
the root cause is that when using the localjobrunner to do the import job it cannot load the jar generate by sqoop
the result of this would generate single row with the count of records in the original relation in your case the intlgt contains more than one row since you have not done any grouping on it
based on your code you re trying to look for sms messages that had an intlgt on either end
then you can filter by startswith srcgt intlgt intlgt because the two of them are fields in the same relation
keytab files contains password as well so it dose not ask for password
and the second question will be answer from the klist command it will show you the principal which is like user host realm so in your case user is some string and when you get ticket of some string user you are some string for kerberos and your commands will be executed as some string user so the owner of files created will be some string
based on the pom xml from that project you should be using the class org apache mahout common distance distancemeasure is included in the mahout core 0
http datafu incubator apache org docs datafu guide bag operations html it comes with bag operation so you can count avg sum and quantile in bags
the issue is observed due to versions mismatch and fixed after re build with correct versions
for me at least the answer is in this bug report https issues apache org jira browse mapreduce 1581 the path might be coming across as a fully qualified path hdfs host 2456 my mr libs myjar jar which in some environments where is the path separator character will lead to a munged set of files hdfs host and 2456 my mr libs myjar jar none of which will result in the right file being added to the class path
if you provide a folder to map reduce it will process all the files in that folder
this error not because you are trying to hadoop on windows
it s because there is some problem with your datanode
along with the point which chris gerken has made there could be some other reasons as well
i had the same problem with hadoop 1 0 3 16 and java 6 but i managed to get the manning example 4 1 working by adding job setjar path to myjob jar after job setjobname myjob i thought of making this change because i was getting a warning warn mapred jobclient no job jar file set
here is what i used and worked for me edit build contrib xml the lines under depends on your hadoop s version i tried all this with a 1 2 1 hadoop edit and add the following lines in build properties in meta inf manifest mf in build xml add after finally execute ant jar and add the generated plug in to eclipse
and if you want add a counter value at start and in order to detect that in the mapper and process accordingly make the file to be a gzipped one this will force hadoop to have as many mappers as the number of files
hence the number of map tasks are governed by the number of input splits which depends on the generic formula
split your input files into 5 small input files so that at least 5 map tasks are created for your 5 node cluster or adjust the parameters such as mapred min split size and dfs block size so that more number of map tasks are created for your input file
you need to find the logs from your mappers and reducers since this is the place where the job is failing as indicated by java lang runtimeexception pipemapred waitoutputthreads subprocess failed with code 1
imo since state is selected as a key shuffle and sort phase should bring all the records with same state together
if you use spark standalone mode with any file system not mounted under the spark executors then all your data requests will need to be pulled over a network connection therefore saturating the network and causing a bottleneck regardless of memory
personally i would use kafka streams here because 1 you are using java already 2 it s a standalone thread in your code that offers you to read publish data from kafka without hadoop yarn or spark clusters
you could also use nifi as your mobile rest api to just exposehttp and send requests to it then route flows based on attributes in the data
this can even be done during query time hence letting the user assign weights depending upon the use case
you are getting en exception which is caused by java lang classnotfoundexception org apache commons logging above class logfactory is not present at org apache commons logging path
based on the reported behavior we can deduce that there is a difference between what s implemented on mysql and what s implemented on apache hive
as far as whether the difference is due to a difference in the join behavior there s not enough information given here to determine why the query against mysql and the query against hive would be returning different results
a list of values is passed as an iterator and objects are often reused to save memory so you can not rely on their contents to remain the same
since you are new and this is the first time i will try answering your question
its usage in the map method is same as the usage of a datatype in any ordinary method or function to tell the type of the variable used in that method
split the text file content based on index for both key and value to generate a pair rdd
you have a shell command so you can use hadoop streaming to just run it and stream the code from hdfs into stdin for your script
if that s not possible then only other option is using tar gz files not deb rpm edit since you are asking about opensemantic as the documentation for it says and you need a local yum mirror because
faster read is because of the usage of b tree data structure for storage
eg sql mysql here comes mpps massive parallel processing mpp systems can handle huge data than a single node of rdbms database since it stores data in a cluster
you could use a simple jdbc library for scala like scalikejdbc to do these queries and capture the primitives in the results
use the percentile function as per the product documentation if you are not able to get expected result then your going to add a lot more detail to your question as in what is the data your query and the expected result
javascript there is a selenium based protocol implementation this can help with js sites nutch is based on hadoop and so is batch driven
i think you should check your cluster healthy at first http namenode1 50070 then maybe you have not close your iptables so you cannot telnet the port when you on server2
based on your comment that there are multiple rows per user id you will need some sort of aggregation otherwise you ll get a yes no for each row in the database not each distinct user
because this code is equivalent to this as you can see all the pieces of your command including are passed to su as command line arguments
naturally su doesn t know what to do with it and thus would fail
it is crucial to understand two things command2 is run only after command1 has finished successfully both command1 and command2 are spawned by the same shell process and thus they both inherit its effective user
in order to fix the issue you should make whoami to be spawned by su so that it could inherit the changed user
to be honest i don t know how to cope with this problem properly so i would suggest to switch to sudo instead
the maximum size i could add to a stringbuilder was integer max size 2 this prints this is writing just one character at a time so it really should be taking any longer than that
it is optional though because with little extra code you can right to mysql only if you don t want to change
spark application will read this file do any transformations write the results to mysql or any other storage systems involved hdfs spark mysql other storage optional cluster to make it scalable
your program is failing because it was not able to detect the file present on hadoop need to specify the file in the following format
since spark builds a dependency graph and evaluates lazily when an action is called you are facing the error when you are trying to call an action
it because you are collecting all data it means that collection is not rdd but normal list and line is just one string
your path to the jar does not exist so the cli is complaining
how difficult is it to find folks with decent programming skills so that they can write mr jobs for you
you should provide specific details like the exception you get steps you follow etc since you have not specified any information at all i would say check for the config files to make sure you have all the required entries in corresponding files in core site xml you should have similarly hdfs site xml should have and finally the mapred site xml should have hope this helps
hadoop is a framework based on distributed storage and distributed processing concepts for processing large data
mahout utilizes hadoop s parallel processing capability to do the processing so that the end user can use this with the large data sets without much complexity
since mahout jobs in distributed mode are mapreduce jobs you should learn hadoop fundamentals and mapreduce programming
usually this indicates that we previously attempted to load a class from the classpath but it failed for some reason now we re trying to use the class again and thus need to load it since it failed last time but we re not even going to try to load it because we failed loading it earlier and reasonably suspect that we would fail again
for example the command line i use in development is bin flume ng agent conf file etc flume ng conf flume conf name castellan indexer conf etc flume ng conf the error message reads that way because the bin flume ng script adds the contents of the conf file argument to the classpath before running flume
this can be due to you are using a 64 bit machine but the hadoop distro is for 32 bit
so after a lot of research i found out that the problem was actually caused by this line in pipes application java line 104 i changed the code and recompiled hadoop i got this from here this solved the problem and my program currently runs but i am facing another problem where the program actually hangs at map 0 reduce 0 i will open another topic for that question
looking at your command it seems that there could be couple of reasons for this issue
i ran the script given by one of the members in that post
the problem arise because the storm jar is run at incorrect directory
this issue can be because of the following reasons your cluster is not having enough resources to launch a container
if something in data is not as per expectations and causing failures in processing then simply mark that record for the re processing by writing that into the logs see example and then you can revisit this file later on time
in that case use replace string d
can you as well share your logs with us so we can have a closer look
the issue might be caused by missing an inbound rule in the nsg for your vm to allow the inbound traffic to the port required by intellij
very likely here or here when read x 1 or parts 1 throws the arrayindexoutofboundsexception because there is no and t inside the string
thanks to realskeptic suggestions i resolved this issue
as ok is there in the output which comes before the result it means nothing was returned from this query
it s probably the type of hashtag is string string so the tail operation is not defined
therefore trying to access it like that doesn t make sense
https hadoop apache org docs r2 7 3 hadoop project dist hadoop hdfs webhdfs html badstatusline in the error might indicate that you re dealing with a kerberized secure cluster so you might need a different way to read files for example pyspark or the ibis project
the program is breaking at string text parsed 1 replace because parsed 1 does not exists
adding more nodemanager nodes overall has no negative consequences and yarn has been reported as running up to 1000 nodes i would suggest using standalone clusters if you actually needed more than that
the error is because you are using todate on 273rd column if your input file has 272 columns then in pig you can access them using positional notation from 0 to 271 also note that year is in yy format instead of yyyy
zip nor gzip are splittable in hadoop processing read able to be computed in parallel so since winzip supports bz2 format i suggest you switch to that and i don t see a need to create split files in windows unless it s to upload the file faster sidenote hadoop fs cat input anything hadoop fs put output is not splitting in hadoop you are copying the raw text of the file to your local buffer then doing an operation locally then optionally streaming it back to hdfs
that way each bulk of words will be assigned to a different partition different jvms and or clusters depending on the total number of partitions and size of data
in your solution the entire sentence is assigned to a specific partition and thus there s no parallelism nor distribution
hence each spark module is complied against specific scala library
i don t know hadoop but i suspect that the root problem is your map method is not overriding the map method in the base class because the signature is different
net result is that your map method is not getting called and npe
the reason is that sometimes heartbeats from the datanode to the namenode are delayed and thus the namenode will flag a datanode as dead
your arguments array seems to be having only two value but you are trying to get the third index value in the following statement leading to arrayindexoutofboundexception try to use debugger for checking the length of your array or try printing it using arguments length
i think it might be caused because you don t have the hadoop natives jar files in the path
please follow the below command which is for mysql similarly you can frame to your database accordingly
what if you run also could you please run and paste results for you can find distribution with checksums here
so you re executing the command which should result in an error since that s not a command i ve ever seen with sql
since the double quotes that are not needed follow closing blackets or a colon and preced opening or closing brackets
results
besides that hdfs isn t required to learn spark so maybe try playing with hadoop fs commands first or move files to local system depending on what your goals are
this happens due to internal mapping between directories
either change it to user training intel nyse csv or just training intel nyse csv no leading to reference a file relative to your current directory
if you are using pr passing aws s3 bucket url with prefix as s3 or s3n then replace it with s3a because spark uses org apache hadoop fs s3a s3afilesystem for s3 communications and you also might have to include hadoop aws 2 7 1 jar on to your classpath
because since your treefra class does not exist the log should not appear
having hadoop installed on vm you can access it based on any of large set of client libraries
make sure you run hive from the same directory every time because when you launch hive cli for the first time it creates a metastore derby db in the current directory
yeah it s due to the metastore not being set up properly
it seems you are getting this error because either two important logging classes commons logging 1 1 1 jar and commons logging api 1 0 4 jar which are related with common logging is either not available from your classpath or you just don t have it
please verify that you do have these files in your machine and are set in your classpath so they are accessible
also when you run hadoop version the version comes up as result the same hadoop core snapshot jar must be in your hadoop home location
you mentioned that you are running wordcount java instead you should say that you are running wordcount job because you are always using the compiled application as jar not java
it seems that you did not include the common logging jar file so download here the jar file depends on version then will included it in your program and run it thank you
the export statement is commented out by a leading so it has no effect
ok so the problem was fixed when i started using newer job configuration classes
till now i was using legacy code which seem to be causing lot of errors
i would suggest to use hadoop and spark because spark uses in memory model which is faster than map reduce
i suspect you are able to log in to one of the nodes with ssh however probably you have not set up passwordless ssh between the nodes so the steps you try to execute from the node will fail
one of issue is the mapper reducer classes are not found on tasktracker nodes because the jar with mapper reducer is not created yet
here is my solution http ben tech blogspot com 2013 04 run mapreduce in play development mode html another issue is caused by the class loader used in play run command
run command creates a class loader that has only dependency jars so that you classes are not in the classpaths when you use class forname
but since combiners are optimizations that run on the mapper nodes then several combiners might be getting called as they perform their operations most likely a sum or a merge of some sort
there is a bit of confusion here when you run the hadoop command then the default filesystem which it uses is the hadoop distributed filesystem hence the files must be located on the hdfs for hadoop to access it
you are complicating yourself for no reason you only need to build hadoop in windows if your system is 32 bits and good luck on that i ve been trying it for 3 weeks
since your system is 64 all you need to do is download a precompiled package
then when you ran again trying to use the same arguments you get this exception because the directory already exists possibly for the same reason discussed above the program is expecting two args
afair hadoop 2 x needs 2 5 x please check your hadoop dependencies and you could just take outdated one because of some external component
just write them together in one class required packages are there might be some extras here since i copied them from my code
i don t know how to use hive to solve this so i solved it with mapreduce
can you post the command line results from running the job including command and counter output
edit anna mai your screenshot shows that the mapper is not emitting any records map output records 0 so the problem is in your mapper
the following snippet will get the job done now in driver just get the map and set the inputpath accordingly may it helps
from cloudera site the key and value classes must be serializable by the framework and hence must implement the writable interface
it is particularly suitable for iterative algorithms because data from the previous iteration can remain in memory
spark is relatively easy to install and play with compared to hadoop so i suggest you give it a try to understand it better for experimentation it can run off a normal filesystem and does not require hdfs to be installed
tiny small medium and big are never initialised so they will be null
clearly this is no good since you won t be able to distinguish between the counts for the different word sizes
even worse tin smal mediu bi are never initialised which will cause nullpointerexceptions when you try to call set on them you initialise result correctly but then never use it
also you don t need to set the intwritables repeatedly within your loop over the values just update t s m b then set the intwritables once at the end before the context write calls update now that mapper code added for each word in the input you are writing key value pairs length 1
the reducer will collect all the values with the same key so it will be called with for example so your reducer will only ever see the value 1 which it is incorrectly treating as a word length
update now that stack trace added the error message explains what is wrong hadoop cannot find your job classes so they are not being executed at all
no way i have also check my code i have done some fixes but the result is the same on hadoop terminal window i can not get any result
as per my understanding the maven access http to build the oozie package so you can update the etc resolv conf with the server ip which is having full http access after words try building the package check if the same got resolved or not
else do this and post the results of each command ping hostname ping 127 0 0 1 telnet hostname telnet hostname port ps aux grep port number
in that case you could almost make the argument that a traditional database like oracle or terra data might be a better fit for your problem as you have lead or lag functions readily available which could be used to do exactly what u need
i couldn t find any reference to a swt table or column in that page also
but that s ok since the 2nd version will get cleaned up on the next compaction
at lithium klout we use a custom built hbaseserde which writes hfiles instead of using put s to insert the data so we generate the hfiles and use the bulk load tool to load all of the data after the job has completed
therefore you cannot cast it to indexedrdd or any other rdd type as its just a normal map
this memory problem usually happens because each container allocates all of its memory to a java process and none or little is left for the r process
if you want to process the files or perform a task in hadoop you need to make sure that your requirements are properly put forward so that hadoop understand what to do with your data
and a c application can run in linux using mono so you can run your c application using both hadoop streaming and mono
2 parse the ctl file of csv and create a hive table a based on that 3 using the same parser create table b with the other ctl table 4 run describe formatted table a and table b by removing entries like createtime lastaccesstime location and put it in a file 5 find difference of each file probably if you can give more details on how the files are by example we can prepare bash scripts to automate it
the output of the following command should produce the same results on kms servers
if your mapper s output key value classes are different from your reducer s output key value class then you need to explicitly add following statements to your driver make following changes in your code set map output key and value class in your case since your mapper and reducer output key and value classes are different you need to set the following job setmapoutputkeyclass intwritable class job setmapoutputvalueclass text class job setoutputkeyclass intwritable class job setoutputvalueclass intwritable class disable combiner since you are using your reducer code for your combiner the output of combiner will be intwritable and intwritable
hence you will get the following exception because it got the value as intwritable instead of text error java io ioexception wrong value class class org apache hadoop io intwritable is not class org apache hadoop io text to remove this error you need to disable the combiner job setcombinerclass myreducer class don t use reducer as a combiner if you definitely need to use a combiner then write a combiner whose output key value are intwritable and text
solved the data upload as i was missing to rank the relation hence hbase rowkey becomes the rank data fil 1 rank data fil 2 note this will generate arbitrary rowkey
the reason that your code runs fine locally from eclipse is because the file is being read from local disk
the nullpointerexception is being displayed because the file cannot be read from your local disk when the code is in hadoop
if you just want to target one file change the paths accordingly
the function in winter returns 600 and in summer it returns 660 and the division by 10 is used because the frequency of the dataset is set to 10 minutes
because if you would have you would know dataframe is a nothing but a combination of schema rdd
your masters file name should contain the address of the secondarynamenode so that namenode can read it you need to configure your fs default name on core site xml configuration file like also you should check on how hdfs namenode format works in hadoop
actually i already updated all the files like in hadoop tutorial and consequently how you tell me here
map reduce framework looks for the directories specified by mapreduce cluster local dir parameter during processing of your job and after that it verifies if there is enough space on the directories or not so that it can create the intermediate files for it
it s better to compress like gzip compression the intermediate output files so that it will take less space during processing
hence to change our current working directory to a virtual file and to work within it would not make sense
in sqoop you can change character set importing data using following parameter i would suggest you to check your oracle database character set and try to set it accordingly in above sqoop parameter source sqoop document
but most hive use cases cause data to be appended to files that are updated using other processes and thus external tables are common
maven can t reach because it has been shut down
based on my different experimentations with various functions with file writing capabilities i found following the fastest where x is just there to capture null returns which sapply throws and sapply of as character is to prevent mess up which cat does to factors printing internal factor value than actual value
when you select data hive does not need to store intermediate results
it can simply produce the result directly
probably because the cluster is full but possibly because it does not have the rights
the above code is all fine but the mistake i was doing while executing was the output where my map reduce result will display is a directory and not the file
so this is the reason why i was getting that error
hence only 0 5 of memory remains available for execution
java doesn t know what to do and therefore throws an exception
it s a bit unclear what you are trying to do since you want to move the text files to hadoop and then generate the text files
the approach you take and technologies you use depend on a few factors such as how you want to use your data export all of it to another system
sqoop is an option if you want to extract from rdms and the extract logic is fairly simple eg extract based on updated date column
lastly you can connect to hive from excel using odbc which can be very useful depending on your use case
however doing analytics across an hbase table is less desirable since hbase will not do full table scans as efficiently as hive
the hive queries will generally be slower due to using hbase scans than if you had used a delimited file instead of hbase
if you don t want to add on the lookup information to every record and using hive isn t desirable because you want random access consider using storm drpc to add on the dimensions on the fly when the data is requested

ok so the problem here is you re doing something that s failing
i m not 100 sure because moo might do something cute with die but i can t find or see where that is

cause the rdd type to be dropped
that s what the error suggest too any action on rdd returns actual dataset depending on what action is called you can read about different action functions in spark here actions in spark rdd now if you want to save data in rdd into the text file you need to call saveastextfile path to file over rdd
in hadoop home directory open etc hadoop hadoop env sh file and add below lines to remove error you can add your user name by replacing root in above commands
not really if you look for a specific column value that is not part of the rowkey hbase needs to perform a full table scan thus it is slower than searching by rowkey
it depends on your use case
though you can convert any external table to managed and vice versa as in your case you are doing frequent modifications in data so it is better that hive should have total control over the data
apart from that managed table are more secure then external table because external table can be accessed by anyone
download each file using wget as mentioned use hdfs put command to upload all files to a single hdfs directory write code that parses the csv columns and counts each airline i assume you ve written wordcount already use that csv directory as your job input and run your code it s not clear where hive needs to fit into this but i would assume you ve been shown how to create an external table over text files so you could do that and run something like select count from airlines group by airline
symbole not found error is may be due to the fact that all the classes used are not imported for example stringtokenizer https docs oracle com javase 7 docs api java util stringtokenizer html the new part are mandatory because you are creating an hadoop text object best regards
so first reason of error on join function is wrong arguments
what i suspect you re doing is you are setting them while initializing sparksession which becomes irrelevant since kernel is already started by then
please check if below query gives your desired result set
first all the grouped data from each table is calculated and then we doing full outer join to include all values of col1 from each table to get result set
finally if the result set is what the desired one we can convert select statement to insert into overwrite statement
the result you get when you throw this command on the shell if you want to know if hdfs is in safemode you have to use the following command if you want to leave from safemode use this command
the server doesn t accept dsa type keys so your client didn t try it
openssh 7 0 and later deprecated support for ssh dss keys because such keys aren t considered to be secure
now log in with your new user again and try run hdfs commands for example hdfs dfs ls so you can do anything what you want in new user
because the permission of the subfolder cannot be more than or equal to the parent folder
so that s all and it s worked for my case
not sure why you re trying to manually add jar files since pyhive or impyla would make you more sense otherwise use pyspark
however you should really do that outside of the container build process because localhost 8020 is the container itself and is not an accessible hdfs location
possible reasons why the data might not be flowing include hadoop is not running
the size of the batch n would depend on how many requests you know your server can handle in a second
with 500k files you are spending a lot of time tree walking to find all these files which then need to be assigned to list of inputsplits the result of getsplits
it largely depends on how strong your submission server is or your laptop client maybe you need to upgrade ram and cpu to make the getsplits call faster
it doesn t work because you ve mixed up classes from mapred with mapreduce
drill is based on google dremel
your problem is that addition of floating point values is not commutative when calculating the sum its cause is the limited precision of double
the block pool id error is majorly due to formatting of namenode multiple times

this is caused by the value of value tostring it either contains no commas or all of the commas in the string are at the end
in the latter case this is because split without a negative limit will strip empty trailing tokens
the reason for the error is already in the message your configuration lists default ccache name keyring persistent uid which stores credentials in a secure kernel buffer on linux
java is not able to read this buffer and thus you will get an error
shashi i don t know if you pasted your exact command lines but if you did you probably need to add quotes around the url so that the is not interpreted by the shell
on mapr 4 1 this works for me but if i remove the quotes as in your example see how the cfname parameter seems to be ignored this is because when the shell got to the it put the command into the background and the cfname parameter never is considered by the server because it does not get there and so maprcli lists all the cfs
apparently there was a problem with the elly package and hence contacted the contributor
thanks to him he fixed the issue in time and i then checkedout the latest elly package
i am guessing the issue is because of how you call join this would join the list cur list with each element having a in between them
so according to your code you are getting correct result
i take it that join abc should always return a b c because a str object is iterable
since you don t have much experience with these things you ll probably want to look at projects like cloudera
i am not sure whether you have downloaded installed the hadoop package or not so let me walk you through the process of it briefly download the latest package using wget wget http apache cs utah edu hadoop common hadoop 2 7 1 hadoop 2 7 1 tar gz extract the package relative to where you have downloaded it tar xzf hadoop 2 7 1 tar gz change the dir into the extracted directory cd hadoop 2 7 1 now you would be able to find or start the hadoop daemons using sbin start all sh you can find the script s you are trying to use in the extracted dir s hadoop 2 7 1 sbin folder
make sure you follow the proper documentation to get it completed properly because i haven t really covered installing java or configuring hadoop which are extensively covered in the following documentation link http hadoop apache org docs current hadoop project dist hadoop common singlecluster html
finally i found out that it was caused by a programming decission
after looking at datanode logs it looks like the error is coming because of namenode
since namenode is down datanode is not able to start properly
parallelism this depends on format of your input data
based on the documentation in the comment by abhiieor you should need rmr2 and not rmr
you have to change the input format for key to longwritable and add a try catch for any exceptions due to empty strings
you can use json serde to fetch all fields just follow below steps 1 download json serde from http www congiu net hive json serde 1 3 2 add json serde jar 3 create table 4 load json file into table 5 fire below query to get result
it has failed because the log directory that hadoop is trying to write has no permission
if you want strictly alphabetical if you want to keep strings that don t have numbers the error you re getting using your function is because you use rlikeas a standalone function which is not it is an attribute for class pyspark columns
there are workarounds though let s start with the sample data what you could do if df1 is not too big meaning a small amount of categories and potentially a lot of values in each category is convert df1 to a list and create an if elif elif condition based on its values list1 df1 collect sc broadcast list1 import pyspark sql functions as psf from pyspark sql import window w window partitionby category orderby year month weeknumber cond eval psf join when df2 category str c psf lag lag attribute str l 0 over w for c l in list1 note this is if c and l are integers if they are strings then cond eval psf join when df2 category str c psf lag lag attribute str l 0 over w for c l in list1 now we can apply the condition df2 select cond alias return test show category year month weeknumber lag attribute runs return test 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 2019 1 1 1 0 0 1 2019 1 2 2 0 0 1 2019 1 3 3 0 0 1 2019 1 4 4 1 1 1 2019 1 5 5 2 2 1 2019 1 6 6 3 3 1 2019 1 7 7 4 4 1 2019 1 8 8 5 5 1 2019 1 9 9 6 6 2 0 0 0 9 0 0 2 2018 1 1 2 0 0 2 2018 1 2 3 2 9 2 2018 1 3 4 3 2 2 2018 1 3 5 4 3 if df1 is big then you can self join df2 on a built lag column first we ll bring the values from df1 to df2 using a join df df2 join df1 category if df1 is not too big you should broadcast it import pyspark sql functions as psf df df2 join psf broadcast df1 category now we ll enumerate the rows in each partition and build a lag column from pyspark sql import window w window partitionby category orderby year month weeknumber left df withcolumn rn psf row number over w right left select left rn left value alias rn left lag attribute alias return test left join right category rn left na fill 0 sort category rn show category rn year month weeknumber lag attribute runs value return test 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 1 2 2019 1 1 1 0 3 0 1 3 2019 1 2 2 0 3 0 1 4 2019 1 3 3 0 3 0 1 5 2019 1 4 4 1 3 1 1 6 2019 1 5 5 2 3 2 1 7 2019 1 6 6 3 3 3 1 8 2019 1 7 7 4 3 4 1 9 2019 1 8 8 5 3 5 1 10 2019 1 9 9 6 3 6 2 1 0 0 0 9 0 2 0 2 2 2018 1 1 2 0 2 0 2 3 2018 1 2 3 2 2 9 2 4 2018 1 3 4 3 2 2 2 5 2018 1 3 5 4 2 3 note there is a problem with your runs lag value for catagory 2 it is only lagging 1 instead of 2 for instance
the two last lines in your sample dataframe df2 have the same category year month and weeknumber in your dataframe since there is shuffling involved you might get different results everytime you run the code
depends on the job yarn jar would be a used for mapreduce not everything is owned by the hdfs user
you need to make user dev user1 hdfs directory owned by that user so that s where the user has a private space
hive is seemingly unrelated to the question asked since hive is installed completely separately from hadoop and hdfs
hadoop uses many many machines and disks to create a distributed filesystem abstraction hence the name hdfs
therefore is not valid spark code
for 2 i m not sure puthivestreaming will work against cloudera iirc they use hive 1 1 x and puthivestreaming is based on 1 2 x so there may be some thrift incompatibilities
for the main file this string always the the value __ main __ so it s an easy way to tell whether a file is the main file executed or just some library
if python tells you there s an indentationerror then malformatted code is very likely the cause
it s fairly save to either remove that block entirely if you only ever use these files as libraries or to unindent it so that the if is fully unindented and the body of the if clause is indented with 4 spaces
as for which version of rocksdb library that will depend on the version of rocksdb you are connecting to it
i m not familiar with any such balancing rules or properties but you can apply node labels in ambari configs such that your datanodes will be loaded with different configs such as the mount points of the datanodes the only way i ve done rebalancing is by the hdfs rebalance cli you could also try putting that dfs datanode fsdataset volume choosing policy property into the custom hdfs site xml section however round robin is the default and the available space one is not recommended based on the cloudera forums i ve found if you want to set it to the available space property anyway it s org apache hadoop hdfs server datanode fsdataset availablespacevolumechoosingpolicy
well the spilled problem was caused by nomethodexception
hence i discovered that my combiner class was missing the word static which solved the problem
imagine for example that your rows represent n dimensional vectors and that your matching function is strong weak or no match based on the euclidean distance between a base vector and a matchset vector
critically these techniques typically come with known bounds on time and space and the probability to find a point within some distance around a given matchset prototype all depending on some parameters of the algorithm
i say largish because joining 200m rows with 10m rows is quite a small if the problem is indeed a join
at the cost of a small replication of the matchset in that case you can get very fast search results
by doing the computations in the map phase and then thresholding and steering the results to strong weak no match reducers you can gather the results for output to separate files
examples include blocking so that you need to do fewer than 200m 10m computations or precomputing constant portions of the algorithm for the 10m match set
but this causes unnecessary io incase you are not interested in the intermediate output
thanks to everyone for the help
mine had been improperly configured with the line this was a result of our using the hortonworks hadoop suite which utilizes ambari and sets up an independent jdk distribution on initial setup
when i have received this error in the past it was because i didn t have an iam role properly defined for my emr cluster
because you wouldn t ask the same question if comparing hadoop and oracle or sap databases right
so your analogy does explain hadoop side of the equation without really giving proper due to aster
counter updates from failed task attempts are not aggregated in job totals so there should be no fear of overcounting
if you are afraid to loose something that is expensive to calculate because of a task failure i would recommend to split your job into multiple map reduce phases
the confluent kafka sink connector for hdfs is the preferable one to use since it replaces camus supports the latest versions of apache kafka is actively maintained and is open source
theoretically this should have worked but since it does not a little work around is needed
are only more efficient compared to using groupbykey followed with an aggregation giving you the same result as one of the other groupby methods could have given
as the wanted result is an rdd key iterable value building the list yourself or letting groupbykey do it will result in the same amount of work
eof means the file was consumed entirely before it could read 1 terabyte of randomly distributed data therefore it exited before trying to sort anything
there is currently an ongoing service interruption latest status at http azure microsoft com en us status so it is very possible that you didn t do anything wrong and just need to try again later
table1 with raw data having 4 columns delimited by comma then concat the first name and last name using select query and store the results in another table using ctas create table as select feature
since iterator does not implement the iterable interface the code will not be compatible
luckily the list interface does extend the iterable interface so all you have to do is remove the iterator call from the end of your created list fix the return type of the call string x method to be iterable string this change probably from iterator to iterable probably happened in a recent version of spark and the example did not get updated yet
in cluster mode driver can go any node and in that way yarn will take care
the causes are i configure wrong files such as hadoop env sh hdfs site xml core site xml mapred site xml
in addition there is a file like mapred site xml template in the usr local hadoop etc hadoop directory therefore you have to copy this file to other file like this command hduser localhost cp usr local hadoop etc hadoop mapred site xml template usr local hadoop etc hadoop mapred site xml i suggest you follow this guide to re configure your system
also that s the results with hadoop checknative command
before the job is submitted the configuration files should be present in all the nodes for the daemons to start so it doesn t make sense to distribute them while submitting the job
my guess is because grouped doesn t contain logs base it contains no nulls
enabled debug logs on the spring xd container running rabbit module it showed following exception repeatedly happening for the first message and message is requeued back thus the message stays in unacknowledged state and rabbit source can not process further messages to resolve the problem from log4j appender properties i removed this property log4j appender amqp contentencoding null
this happens due to presence of bad records
again don t use stringtokenizer it s still in existence due to legacy reasons
as far as logic goes split size will never lead to java heap space error
the reason for this error is by calling job setcombinerclass mutualsuggestreducer class it executes the reducer functions once and again by calling job setreducerclass mutualsuggestreducer class the program tried to execute reducer function again
they also agree that its issue in the sandbox https community hortonworks com questions 34426 failure to execute hive query from lab 2 html comment 35900
the reducers python script is generating errors because the variable curr show was only declared with in the line reading for loop
the reason for the error only occurring when using the hadoop command and not for the piping command is because of scooping with which i am very unfamiliar
also the count variable was changed to reset to the current value in so that the current value at the time of the change in show is not lost
to solve your problem you need to instantiate an instance create an object of your class so the run time can reserve memory for the instance or change the part you are accessing it to have static access not recommended
the keyword this is for referencing something that s indeed an instance hence the this thing and not something that s static which in that case should be referenced by the class name instead
the interval of the checkpoint is not only dependent on time
it depends on some other factors also
depending on that the checkpoint frequency may vary
best explanation of what secondary namenode is really meant for http blog madhukaraphatak com secondary namenode what it really do secondary namenode s whole purpose is to have a checkpoint of namenode in hdfs so that it can save the latest possible image of namenode in events of namenode crash failure its not the replacement for the namenode and then use this checkpoint to bring namenode up again
good question the reason for this behaviour is that it can take over the role from the primary namenode and become the primary
this happens during the failover either caused by an outage or maintenance
assuming you already fixed this since you submitted 10 months ago but try the full hdfs input hdfs server port input 1901
that can result in the main class in the jar file manifest being null instead of null
did you try using a separate so the data gets distributed by a certain key while they are being sorted
the stacktrace showing like hdfs ec2 52 55 2 64 compute 1 amazonaws com 9000 input in your code output directory mentioned as input so the above exception occurred
you get a result from your first query select from customers because hive doesn t use map reduce to get result are you sure about your hadoop configuration
here you may find the reason why it is throwing error
passwordless ssh is already the default and you would have to specifically enable ssh login with a password and it would not be a good idea to do so because it is less secure than using a keypair which i assume is what you mean by ssh login without password
for more information see these pages http docs aws amazon com emr latest managementguide emr connect master node ssh html http docs aws amazon com awsec2 latest userguide ec2 key pairs html it is difficult to tell what the problem is because you have not provided much information but it sounds like you may have ssh d to the cluster as ec2 user
did you install jdk correctly based on whether 32bit 64bit
since it hasn t you could create it yourself using a command similar to hdfs dfs mkdir hdfs cdh test user hive warehouse employee hive although the exact command depends on your hdfs set up
this will guarantee that the values will be increasing so they can be ordered but does not mean that they will be sequential
the ordering is important because you want to look for rows that come after a return
since this returns the cartesian product we will filter it to just the rows that meet either of the following conditions l index r index essentially join a row to itself l id r org id and l index r index an id is equal to a org id from an earlier row this is where the index column is helpful then we add a column for group id and set it equal to r id if the second condition is met
thus we just need to select the rows where the rownum is equal to 1 row number starts at 1 not 0
orc is a compression technique to store data in optimised way so you can load your data into orc format table by following below steps
so check in that location you will see the data
first you have to create a spark session variable so that you could access all spark functions next if you want to load a csv file you can specify optional parameters like headers inferschema etc file will now be a pyspark dataframe
run with sudo will get you result for example
the reducers are failing to fetch the maps due to failing too many attempts which could be due to a networking configuration problem preventing them being able to query the jetty server
i encountered this error also caused by java io ioexception exceeded max failed unique fetches bailing out
i was looking for help for two weeks but this afternoon i found an intersting page http wiki apache org hadoop hadoopmapreduce highlight inputf thus i explored the second point
in my example the first mapreduce job stores its results in an s3 bucket
that result then becomes the input for the second job
you can keep chaining jobs in this way since the alive flag makes sure the cluster doesn t shut down until you manually terminate it
in the mapper your key value pair will be the word object pair or object word depending on what you are doing
you might want to look at avro first since it doesn t require static code generation which might be more suitable for you
for that reason most appropriate solution is hbase which use hadoop file system and can quickly retrieve any binary data from store by key id name etc
i thought of suggesting this project because corpus from wikipedia is easily available but as you can see it is already in progress
the problem is that in job 2 keyvaluetextinputformat produces key value pairs of type and you re attempting to process them with a mapper that accepts resulting in a classcastexception
since you are using intarraywritable as the output of the reducer its easy to write and later read the data as binary
did you run hbase home bin start hbase sh it s early and i don t have access to my install so the exact script name may be off where hbase home is the install path for hbase
they can have any side effects
since hashpartitioner is used
in general without knowing your use case it s usually preferable to avoid side effect with hadoop
this is basically relying on a 3rd party system outside of hadoop as it can bottleneck your performance and potentially topple the system over due to threading
you will probably have to create your own compass integration since the hbase plugin replaces the standard hibernate plugin
also post your config files so we can debug them
the copyfromlocal command will upload directories recursively by default so you don t need the
reader readline probably reads one character at a time because it needs to find out where the end of line is
therefore checking character by character probably isn t going to be much slower
since it is looking for usr lib64 libstdc so 6 it seems you mapper is compiled with 64bit compiler are you sure the jvm is also 64bit
i have a feeling it is this 64 bit thing which is causing the broken pipes
i am assuming that status code 127 error was the result of the java runtime execute not finding the shell script
in that case these two steps will work although not create a valid output
also on the build tab make sure they are checked so that they are included in the output of the plugin
a regular or a streaming job will run the way it is configured so we know ahead of time in which mode a job is run
this is because of that you probably wrote in mapred site xml hdfs ip port it starts with hdfs this is wrong but when you write hostname port you probably did not write hdfs at the beginning of the value which is correct way
therefore firstone did not work but second has worked fatih haltas
it seems that hdfs uses host name only for it s all communication and display purposes so we can not use ip directly in core site xml and mapred site xml
maybe in this case you can just do this scan either in the map or the reduce phase based on what additional processing you want to do but my suggestion assumes that you actually need to filter the datawarehouse based on the subsets
since now i have a better stronghold on hadoop and mapreduce here is what i had expected to start a cluster the code will remain more or less same as in the question but we can add config parameters to add job steps step 1 ruby elastic mapreduce jobflow jobflo id jar s3 somepath job one jar arg s3 somepath input one arg s3 somepath output one args m mapred min split size 52880 m mapred task timeout 0 step2 ruby elastic mapreduce jobflow jobflo id jar s3 somepath job two jar arg s3 somepath output one arg s3 somepath output two args m mapred min split size 52880 m mapred task timeout 0 now as for the java code there will be one main class which would contain one implementation each of the following classes org apache hadoop mapreduce mapper org apache hadoop mapreduce reducer each of these have to override methods map and reduce to do the desired job
setting variable won t help because hadoop fetch java home variable value only from hadoop env sh
your hdfs status is not correct you can resolve it with these steps stop hbase and hadoop master and datanode jps to show not released process in master and datanode normally your error caused by the hbase process not successful released kill the process in step2 restart hadoop and hbase
i would not suggest t o convert result sets to hadoop s writable classes it will hinder performance
now give that hostname as the value for zookeeper quorum this step is important because hbase recognises only hostnames and not ip addresses
i couldn t load thet file because of unnecessary enter in the line but fixing that didn t get expected result
i ve removed all enters from the file so finaly i have only one line
since you have access to unix binary source code your best option might be to implement the particular function s you want in java
for me this happended because hadoop wasn t able to create a mapreduce job logs on hadoop logs userlogs jobid attemptid ulimit is of course one of the highest possibility
but for me it was because the disk we were using was full somehow and creating the log files failed
i found this in the error log output of my mapreduce job when it failed due to this directory running out of space
what does the following commands give you running a job does not automatically dump the results of the job to the console they are most typically stored in hdfs in your case in the path user james wiki result
coming to hbase bloom filters please go thru this link it describes multiple options of bloom depending on pattern hbase bllom filters
it depends on how much data you have
try and post the result because many people are facing this i think
so for example you d have a jar with the following contents a jar is just a zip file so you can use regular zip creation utilities to build it for various reasons this also performs better than adding the class files of your dependency to the jar directly
apparently mr defaults to longwritable as the mapoutputkeyclass which in your case should be text and hence the error
as 127 0 1 1 always create problem i dont know the reason otherwise i would have told you
whether you run the fairscheduler or the capacityscheduler you should still be able to run jobs in parallel but there are some reasons that you may see that your jobs run sequentially are you the only person using the cluster if not how many other people are using it question what does the job tracker web ui show for total running jobs
while i can t find any evidence of this fact in the hadoop docs there is a mention in the pro hadoop book that mentions something to this effect http books google com books id 8dv ezekigqc pg pa133 dq 22the uri must be on the jobtracker shared file system 22 hl en sa x ei jngxt lkokla6ag1 7j6bg ved 0cesq6aewaa v onepage q 22the 20uri 20must 20be 20on 20the 20jobtracker 20shared 20file 20system 22 f false in your case copy the file to hdfs first and the when you call distributedcache addcachefile pass the uri of the file in hdfs and see if that works for you
your user tavasthi is not the user dsslmn and therefore does not have permission to write to the home folder rwxr xr x denotes that only the user has write permissions
note that not all output formats show zero file bytes for an empty file sequence files for example have a header so you can t just check the output file size
look at the source for the following files outputcommitter the base abstract class fileoutputcommitter most fileoutputformats use this committer so it s a good place to start
to avoid this default zero sized output you can use lazyoutputformat setoutputformatclass from my experience even if you are using lazyoutputformat zero sized files are created when reducer has some data to write so output file is created but reducer gets killed before writing the output
i believe this is a timing issue so you might observe that only partial reducer output files are present in hdfs or you may not observe this at all
the possible cause for the problem might be missing setjarbyclass call in your driver
obviously you have long since forgotten about this but i ll reply anyway no it s not possible to force a stream
the whole hadoop programming model is about taking files as input and outputting files and possibly creating side effects e g
i haven t used this particular inputformat but hive assumes that records are delimited by n so you would need to make sure that your xml has no n
cause the problem is that the shared directory will change over the time and after some time other project will not work anymore cause someone removed some dependencies etc
cause the problem is that the shared directory will change over the time and after some time other project will not work anymore cause someone removed some dependencies etc so it s better to hold the dependencies into the pom which they intended for
via this it s possible to have a defined set of dependencies which is not needed to maintain in every project only in this single pom project which is responsible for the dependencies
based on your edits i think the premise of your question is wrong
based on the error it seems some of the configuration is missing that why service addition failed
from the output the error is due to being unable to find sbt assembly07 3
when you dig there thru the jobtracker ui you could see that the root cause was so besides the usual we should add and so on for any jar used by the udf
chhaya you might not need to build libhdfs so depending on how you installed hadoop you might already have it
again without the source i m unable to confirm as to whether the checksums of each block are verified on startup too which could be the cause for the 100 cpu
thanks i think my cpu usage so high because the leap second i think the problem is java when i start hadoop cpu usage so high
so modify your mapper to mapper text text text doublewritable and the map method accordingly and then transform the text to double by yourself
if you are scanning a section of the table then that might be the cause of your problem as your data source isn t big enough to trigger multiple mappers
you can try to decrease the region size in your hbase size xml configuration and restart hbase to achieve the desired effect
if you are running this command from within a hadoop tool or in job configure say why spawn a separate process whose exit code you seem to be ignoring hence no errors when you can call it natively in java like srcpath getfilesystem cfg rename srcpath dstpath
you ll need to post your version of the code to be sure but i imagine you have a method called cacheitemset which is defined as static scope loadurlmapping is not defined as a static method and therefore you are getting a compile error
if the mapper called java concept hadoopconceptrunner i guess it would barf since the classpath is not defined thus the class would not be found so in short try again like this also i think the following is unlikely to work you could try instead
it has missing append support which causes hbase to lose data occasionally
those ips obviously wouldn t work for clients outside of ec2 so any operation where a datanode was involved and getting hit from outside of ec2 would screw up
if you do then you will get a classcastexception because of the docr foo since the text instance is in no way a docr object
a method declaration typically cannot cause a class cast exception
in my test i had 20 different users so naturally the result gives me 20 for each song
since this is hadoop streaming you d have to figure out where how to place that pickle file into the zip d code module that is added into the hadoop job s jar
just because a converson doesn t exist doesn t mean it s not easy to create a trivial one now you just need to
as ian stevents pointed out in the comments this is because you are having a typo in the decorator
in addition since you want all the mappers outputs to go to the same reducer the mapper output key must be the same over all mappers
the mappers will look like this the reducer there are other possible ways to solve this problem for example using the mapreduce framework itself to sort the numbers so that the first number the reducer receives is the smallest
the oom exception still persists so i would start a new thread instead of continuing here
in any case the following is invalid should be so it would not be true that in a view works fine
jdbc in general will not support parallelism so that presents a bottleneck for large scale loads
in that kind of primary standby architecture how about pulling data from the standbys via mysql backups to tsv then loading those in parallel into hdfs
you can t change the key during comparing because the record that being compared is just a copy of the record
the reason it s doing this because set s the file name based on a characteristic of the data not the identity of the reducer
you have a couple of choices rework your map job so so that the key that s emitted matches up with the hash that your calculating in this job
a common reason behind this especially if it is consistent in failure this way is the lack of proper client datanode connectivity owing to firewalls or other reasons
on on eof the machines where i have the version with build number i want i ve copied all hadoop deb files then i simply run dpkg i for all packages and thus i can install the appropriate version
i just needed to restart mapreduce stop mapred sh start mapred sh so that it loaded and distrubted my new jars appropriately
mint is not just ubuntu like it is actually built on ubuntu so you should be able to find the answer pretty easy for that
first i ll admit that i ve never used the multipart feature of s3cmd so i can t speak to that
unless you are careful to ensure that they are writing into different column qualifiers you could overwrite one update with another due to race conditions
without seeing your exceptions i would guess that you are failing because you are trying to write key value pairs from your source table into your index table where the column family doesn t exist
the main issue was that my work local machine is windows based whereas the clusters are linux based so i had to convert the file written in dos to unix format
it used to break with windows newlines but since 2006 it should work just fine
i was having the same problem the eclipse plugin you have created from ant will not work in this case may be because it overwrites some hadoop configuration check buid xml for more details it is mainly due to the hadoop eclipse version not matching with your hadoop installation
there are several issues when dealing with hadoop streaming and binary files hadoop doesn t know itself how to process image files mappers are taking the input from the stdin line by line so you need to create an intermediate shell script that writes the image data from the stdin to some temp
just passing the directory location to the executables is not really efficient since in this case you ll loose data locality
i don t want to repeat the already well answered questions on this topic so here are the links using amazon mapreduce hadoop for image processing hadoop how to access many photo images to be processed by map reduce
note that you have to provide them to the tasktracker nodes beforehand with the correct file permissions so that they are executable from java code
i am still trying this out and i don t think this will work on an elastic cluster since you would have to recompile your binaries depending on your cluster s os architecture
now if you do this approach repeatedly writing interim results without the need to do so you will of course be slower than if you would do everything in memory
different mappers would thus perform the operations on different chunks of your input in parallel
to merge the output files try using a reducer which sorts the output segy based on the keys
thus all data of the various output files get routed to one reducer and thus one output part r 000 file gets generated
this happens because the hadoop framework reuses the instances of the objects in order to avoid object creation and garbage collection as much as possible
so if you move the statement so that it is inside the for loop you should see all the keys come by
because of this effect i make my jobs with essentially the following rule this implies that everything i may need must be present in the value
filenames with colon are not supported as hdfs path as mention in these jira but will work by converting it into hex but when sqoop is trying to read that path again it is converting it to colon hence it cant able to find that path i suggest to remove time part from your directory name and try again hope this answer your question
bzip2 is splittable so when your file size exceeds your block size and your bzip2 codec is configured right your file will be split automatically and thus your map tasks would increase automatically
by default lzo archives aren t splittable but there s a way to index them so they become splittable
its because you have not included the required hadoop libraries
if so this will cause hadoop to incorrectly consider that json object as two separate records
this is what i did to solve my problem i did verify that i do have the hive jdbc connector installed in my cluster i modified the following settings in hive site xml correctly depending on my local settings
looks like your using the new api classes you mapper extends mapred mapper but you have written your map method using the old api you are using outputcollector and reporter change your mapper map signature and reducer reduce method to the following it also helps if you add the override annotation above the methods which will cause the compiler to fail if you have the wrong signature
give me example for input data so that i can assist you with a solution
the namenode is picked up from masters file therefore essentially fsimage and edit logs will be written only on namenode and not in the datanode even though you copy the same hdfs site xml
the root cause of this issue resides in your etc hosts file
if you check your etc hosts file you will find a entry something like the one below in my case mu machine is named domainnameyouwanttogive the following lines are desirable for ipv6 capable hosts the root cause is that domainnameyouwanttogive resolves to 127 0 1 1 which is incorrect as it should resolve to 127 0 0 1 or a external ip
the combinefilerecordreader configures a configuration property for the current file it is processing so you should be able to obtain the current file name from the map input file property if you re using the old api mapred the property name is the same
things that make be causing this error message does the directory path to the directory exist does the user under which the datanode process is running have permissions to create write to this directory home srikmvm hadoop 0 23 0 tmp current bp 876979163 137 132 153 125 13602411944 23 current finalized
only if the user is doing something special like a large map side join would there be reason to bump it up
to answer my own question so other s can find it
something like and make sure to restart the cluster so it picks it up
it might be that some configuration error is resulting in the aborting of the job
if they are not there then compile using this instruction link because native library are only tested with nix platform i e
unix linux systems then load libraries into your filesystem as mentioned useful other links even if this is not working then try with hadoop 0 20 because thats working with windows 64 bit for example you can try hadoop 0 20 2 bin hadoop jar home trendwise apache hadoop 0 20 2 hadoop 0 20 2 examples jar pi 16 1000
the problem you have occurs due to the absence of bin utils
you will find the reason
according to my experience it is most probably due to zookeeper connection failure
ok this took me some time to solve this so i leave this answer to anyone who might bump into this
the reason was that since i used canopy to calculate the first centers for kmeans and canopy was not configured with runclustering true it did not generate the policy file
it sounds more like an issue with the user not being able to read the results folder if it is the reducer throwing the error
this will cause your map task to fail on the first exception and thus terminate your job a little faster
in this case they are using a recommender based on similar users and from what i see in your question you are using the one based on similar items
because while creating table you are explicitly specifying table data location to be on s3 file system rather than the one defined in hive default with keyword location
finding the erroneous dependencies may be tedious therefore i d suggest you to include the jboss tattletale plugin in your build phase
you re seeing either an integer overflow or an integer divide by zero in native code sigfpe caused by fpe intdiv
as you can see in the error impala only supports expected describe select show use insert so no create table yet
there are a number of reasons that characters like
that mahout main method is loading classes dynamically based on the arguments that you pass into it and if they are malformed then you could get a nosuchmethoderror like above
i have figure out this question i know i am replying to my own question but this is only because i want to let others know if they have the same problem
this problem is coming because i have mentioned my combiner class as same as that of reducer class but as per this problem input output of mapper is not same as input output of reducer whereas combiner should have same input output as that of mapper
for matthew s solution you probably need to put this in the loop to wait for all the values being set in order to get the correct result
your properties file is empty so it may be that your configuration for this job is off on the cluster
your map method is not able to override mapper s map method due to your use of a capital m in place of a lower case m as such the default identity map method is being used which results in the same key and value pair used as input also being used as output
due to your mapper having specified extends mapper longwritable text text intwritable your attempted output of longwritable text instead of text intwritable is causing the exception
problem solved it turns out that i made two mistake 1 i added a system out println in the beginning of configure but it didn t show up it turns out that mapreduce can t use system out println in mapreduce phases if we want to see the it we need to check our log for details thanks to where does hadoop mapreduce framework send my system out print statements
stdout 2 my real error is related to distributedcache i added a file and want to read it into memory to open the path we need filesystem getlocal as following thanks to hadoop filenotfoundexcepion when getting file from distributedcache
your query is wrong this cannot return any sensible values since you are asking for so it can only ever return null
ok i figured this one out thanks to a page from a very well written blog
