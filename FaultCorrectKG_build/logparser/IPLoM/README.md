# IPLoM - Iterative Partitioning Log Mining

IPLoM is one of the state-of-the-art algorithms for log parsing. It leverages the unique characteristics of log messages for iterative log partitioning, which thus enables efficient message type extraction. Since the original open-source implementation is not available anymore, we re-implement the algorithm using Python with a nice interface provided.
