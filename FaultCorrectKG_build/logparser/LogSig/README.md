# LogSig

LogSig is a message signature based algorithm to generate system events from textual log messages. By searching
the most representative message signatures, logSig categorizes log messages into a set of event types. logSig can
handle various types of log data, and is able to incorporate humanâ€™s domain knowledge to achieve a high performance. We implemented LogSig using Python with a nice interface for benchmarking purpose.
