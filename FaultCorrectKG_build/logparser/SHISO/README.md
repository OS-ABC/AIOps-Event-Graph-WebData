# SHISO

SHISO is a method for mining log formats and retrieving log types and parameters in an online manner. By creating a structured tree using the nodes generated from log messages, SHISO refines log format continuously in realtime. We implemented SHISO using Python with a nice interface for benchmarking purpose.
